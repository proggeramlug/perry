# @perryts/perry

Native TypeScript compiler. Compiles TypeScript source code directly to native executables via LLVM — no VM, no JIT warmup, no Node at runtime.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @perryts/perry
# or one-shot
npx @perryts/perry compile hello.ts -o hello && ./hello
```

Installing picks the right prebuilt binary for your platform automatically — `@perryts/perry` declares per-platform packages as `optionalDependencies` and npm (≥8.12) selects the matching one based on `os` / `cpu` / `libc`.

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Package |
|---|---|
| macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) | `@perryts/perry-darwin-arm64` |
| macOS x64 (Intel) | `@perryts/perry-darwin-x64` |
| Linux x64 (glibc) | `@perryts/perry-linux-x64` |
| Linux arm64 (glibc) | `@perryts/perry-linux-arm64` |
| Linux x64 (musl / Alpine) | `@perryts/perry-linux-x64-musl` |
| Linux arm64 (musl / Alpine) | `@perryts/perry-linux-arm64-musl` |
| Windows x64 | `@perryts/perry-win32-x64` |
| Windows arm64 | `@perryts/perry-win32-arm64` |

### Linux: glibc version

The glibc packages are built against a glibc 2.31 sysroot, so they need **glibc ≥ 2.31**. That covers Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, RHEL 9+ and Amazon Linux 2023 with the native glibc build. On an older glibc the launcher automatically runs the fully-static musl build instead, which has no libc dependency ([#6298](https://github.com/PerryTS/perry/issues/6298), [#6351](https://github.com/PerryTS/perry/issues/6351)). It prints a one-time notice when it does; set `PERRY_NO_FALLBACK_NOTICE=1` to silence it.

npm only installs the musl package when it thinks the machine is musl-based, so on an old-glibc host you have to ask for it once:

```bash
npm install --force @perryts/perry-linux-x64-musl   # or -arm64-musl
```

The launcher tells you this (with the exact command) instead of letting the binary fail in the dynamic loader. The static build is the same compiler; the one thing it cannot do is build `perry/ui` GTK4 desktop apps. The glibc package includes GTK4 support, whose system development libraries must be available when linking a UI app.

## Host requirements

Perry produces native binaries by linking its runtime and stdlib (shipped as static archives in the platform package) into your code. That link step uses your system C toolchain, so you need:

- **macOS** — Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- **Linux** — `gcc` or `clang` (e.g. `apt install build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu, `apk add build-base` on Alpine), plus **clang ≥ 15**: codegen emits opaque-pointer LLVM IR, which clang 14 and older reject with `error: expected type`. Ubuntu 22.04 defaults to clang 14 — `apt install clang-15` and `export PERRY_LLVM_CLANG=/usr/bin/clang-15`.
- **Windows** — MSVC / Visual Studio Build Tools with the C++ workload

Node.js 16 or later is required for the wrapper itself.

## Usage

```bash
perry compile file.ts -o out      # compile to native binary
perry --version                   # print version
perry --help                      # full CLI reference
```

## Prebuilt runtime profiles

Native Unix packages include a core runtime alongside the full runtime. When
the source checkout is unavailable, the compiler can select the core archive
for runtime-only programs whose existing feature analysis needs no optional
engines. Programs using regex, Intl/Temporal, dynamic evaluation, native modules,
workers, or FFI retain the existing fallback. A missing core archive also falls
back, so older and partial installations remain usable.

The core profile includes the Math namespace and preserves the allocator and
unwind policy. It reduces the code
linked into eligible programs; smaller binaries do not by themselves establish
lower startup time or RSS. `--no-auto-optimize` keeps the full-archive path.
