# Compiler Flags

Reference for the public `perry compile` flags plus Perry's global flags. The
installed binary remains authoritative for feature-gated commands; use
`perry --help` and `perry <command> --help` to inspect that exact build.

## Build-time defines

`--define NAME=EXPR` is repeatable. It replaces unbound identifier reads and
dotted names before lowering, including `typeof` guards, object shorthand,
and worker paths. Local variables and parameters with the same name retain
their normal meaning. Values are JSON expressions or identifier expressions;
quote a JavaScript string inside the shell argument:

```sh
perry compile src/index.ts --define 'OPENCODE_VERSION="1.18.30"' \
  --define 'process.env.OPENTUI_LIBC="glibc"'
```

The nearest `perry.json` above the entry can hold the same expressions:

```json
{
  "define": {
    "OPENCODE_VERSION": "\"1.18.30\"",
    "OPENCODE_CHANNEL": "\"latest\"",
    "OPENCODE_MODELS_DEV": "{\"provider\":{\"models\":{}}}"
  }
}
```

Strings in `perry.json` are JavaScript expressions, as in Bun's `define` map.
Existing `package.json` `perry.define` strings keep their literal-string
meaning. Precedence is package literals, then `perry.json`, then CLI flags;
the last CLI value wins. Both build and object caches include the effective map.

Large JSON-compatible literals (including defines) can stay serialized in the
executable and use the built-in JSON parser when evaluated. Two thresholds
control this, independently of generated function instruction budgets:

- Flat arrays of numbers, strings, booleans and null use this path at 1,024
  value nodes or 64 KiB of string data.
- All other JSON-compatible object/array literals use it at 24,576 value nodes
  or 1 MiB of key/string data, to avoid excessive LLVM code generation.

Nodes include the root and nested values; bytes count UTF-8 key/string content,
excluding whitespace. Mid-size records keep ordinary lowering and its static
property layouts for fast reads. Each evaluation still creates a fresh value,
and `typeof` guards fold before lowering. Literals with JavaScript-specific
behavior, such as a `__proto__` setter, keep ordinary expression lowering.

`import.meta.resolve(specifier[, parent])` returns a `file://` URL for filesystem
targets and a `node:` specifier for supported builtins. Literal
module and asset specifiers resolve at compile time; dynamic specifiers resolve
from the calling module or an explicit directory/file URL at runtime, including
packages installed in that directory's `node_modules` after compilation.
Resolution does not execute the target module. Missing runtime targets throw
an error with code `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Static URLs refer to the resolved
files; deploy those files when the application reads their contents.

For OpenCode v1.18.30, after installing its dependencies, run:

```sh
MODELS_DEV_API_JSON=/path/to/models-snapshot.json \
  bun scripts/build_opencode.ts /path/to/opencode --perry /path/to/perry \
  --output ./opencode-native
```

The harness merges release defines into `packages/opencode/perry.json`, reads
the version from OpenCode's package, uses channel `latest`, imports upstream
`script/generate.ts` for the models snapshot, and supplies native worker source
entries. Use `--os linux --libc glibc` (or `musl`) for the eight Linux defines;
`--prepare-only` writes the configuration without compiling. Other OpenCode
compatibility requirements are tracked separately in issue #10107.

## Global Flags

Available on all commands:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format text\|json` | Output format (default: `text`) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Increase verbosity (repeatable: `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`) |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress non-error output |
| `--no-color` | Disable ANSI color codes |

Successful compilation keeps Cargo, clang, Swift, and linker implementation
details out of the default output. Pass `--verbose` to stream those toolchain
diagnostics; if an internal tool fails, Perry shows its captured output even
without `--verbose`.

Use `--output-type` to change what's produced:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `executable` | Standalone binary (default) |
| `dylib` | Shared library (`.dylib`/`.so`) for [plugins](../plugins/overview.md) |
| `staticlib` | Static archive (`.a`/`.lib`) exposing `perry_module_init` for a native host |

## General Build and Platform Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output <PATH>` | Output executable, bundle, shared library, archive, or object path. |
| `--platform node\|bun` | Select the JavaScript host global surface. `node` is the default; `bun` installs a real, stable `Bun === globalThis.Bun` namespace. |
| `--libc glibc\|musl` | Select Linux libc/linkage; `musl` upgrades the corresponding Linux target to a fully static headless build. |
| `--app-bundle-id <ID>` | Bundle identifier required by home-screen widget targets. |
| `--bundle-extensions <DIR>` | Discover and statically bundle native extension packages from a directory. |
| `--type-check` | Run the native TypeScript checker (`@typescript/native-preview`) before codegen. |
| `--min-windows-version 7\|8\|10` | Set the Windows PE compatibility floor; ignored for non-Windows targets. |
| `--windows-subsystem auto\|console\|windows` | Select the Windows PE subsystem instead of relying on import-based auto detection. |
| `--skip-swift-build` | For Apple widget targets, emit SwiftUI source and metadata without invoking `swiftc`. |
| `--p12-keystore <PATH>` / `--p12-password <VALUE>` | Select HarmonyOS HAP signing material. Prefer the corresponding environment/config sources for secrets. |
| `--harmonyos-cert <PATH>` | HarmonyOS application certificate chain. |
| `--harmonyos-profile <PATH>` | HarmonyOS signed provisioning profile. |
| `--harmonyos-key-alias <NAME>` | HarmonyOS keystore alias; defaults to `debugKey`. |

### Bun platform mode

`perry compile app.ts --platform bun` exposes Perry's implemented Bun APIs
through one real global namespace. Direct calls, extracted or destructured
methods, optional chaining, and computed property reads all resolve through the
same `Bun` object. The default `node` mode preserves the historical behavior:
`typeof Bun` remains `"undefined"`, while Perry's existing direct Bun shims and
imports from `"bun"` continue to work.

In this mode, `Bun.version` is Perry's runtime crate version, not a claimed Bun
release number. `Bun.isStandaloneExecutable` is always `true`, because Perry
produces standalone binaries. Unsupported properties are absent; a direct call
to an unsupported `Bun.*` member raises Perry's Bun compatibility error.

`Bun.spawn` supports the command-array and `{ cmd, ...options }` forms, piped
output consumers such as `child.stdout.text()`, lifecycle controls, and raw-fd
or `Bun.file` stdio. On POSIX targets, `Bun.Terminal` can attach a subprocess
to Perry's native PTY implementation; ConPTY-backed terminals are not yet
available on Windows.

## Embedding Assets

Bake static files (an SPA `dist/`, images, JSON, fonts, …) into the standalone
executable so it runs with no external files on disk (#5731).

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--embed <pattern>` | Embed a file, directory, or `*`/`**` glob (relative to the project root). Repeatable. Merged with `perry.embed` (package.json) and `[compile] embed` (perry.toml). |
| `--bunfs-root <dir>` | Map an extracted Bun standalone root to `/$bunfs/root/`; mapped module paths resolve natively and literal file paths remain readable from the relocated executable. |
| `--asset-module <specifier=dir>` | Generate a virtual module whose default export maps every file below `dir` to a stable `$perryfs` handle. Repeatable; source maps are excluded. |

```bash
vite build
perry compile server.ts --embed "./dist/**" -o myapp
./myapp   # serves dist/ from memory — no dist/ folder needed
```

Embedded files are reachable at runtime three ways:

```typescript,no-test
import { embeddedFiles, readEmbedded, isStandaloneExecutable } from "perry";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

for (const f of embeddedFiles()) {
  // f.name (e.g. "dist/index.html"), f.size, f.type (MIME)
  app.get("/" + f.name, (_, reply) => reply.type(f.type).send(readEmbedded(f.name)));
}

// or via node:fs at the `$perryfs/<path>` virtual path:
const html = readFileSync("$perryfs/dist/index.html", "utf8");
```

`embeddedFiles()` is a function (not a bare value like Bun's `embeddedFiles`) so
that array methods dispatch on its result. `readEmbedded(path)` and `node:fs`
accept either the `$perryfs/<path>` virtual path or the embed-relative key.

Bun-compatible file-loader imports embed the referenced binary automatically
and bind the default import to its `$perryfs` path:

```typescript,no-test
import sound from "./sound.mp3" with { type: "file" };
```

For source extracted from a Bun standalone executable, mount its extracted
`root/` directory at Bun's original virtual prefix:

```bash
perry compile --bunfs-root ./fixture/root ./fixture/root/entry.js -o app
```

Static imports, re-exports, literal dynamic imports, literal `require()`, and
`import.meta.require()` calls below `/$bunfs/root/` resolve against that directory.
Perry canonicalizes
their real targets, so importing the same module through `./chunk.js` and
`/$bunfs/root/chunk.js` still initializes one module. Literal mapped file paths
are embedded under their original names and work through both `node:fs` and
`Bun.file()` after the extracted directory is removed. No host-level
`/$bunfs` directory or compatibility symlink is needed.

Bun bundles can load compiled chunks synchronously with
`import.meta.require("./chunk.js")` or `import.meta["require"]("./chunk.js")`.
Both return the module namespace immediately and initialize the target once,
at its first load. Computed paths use the existing bounded synchronous
`require(expr)` resolver; unknown targets throw `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at the call.

Some build pipelines inject a generated module rather than writing it into the
source checkout. Reproduce that file-map step with `--asset-module`. Perry
sorts the directory walk, preserves each `{ type: "file" }` edge, and keeps the
generated source in its cache rather than modifying the checkout.

For the pinned OpenCode source graph, build the upstream web UI first, then
compile from `packages/opencode`'s package root:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app build
perry compile packages/opencode/src/index.ts \
  --asset-module 'opencode-web-ui.gen.ts=../app/dist' \
  -o opencode
```

The first command is the upstream preparation step; Perry reproduces only the
deterministic `opencode-web-ui.gen.ts` file map. A missing/empty `dist` or a
missing generated import fails with a remediation message instead of becoming
an unresolved-import warning. Run the preparation command for every source
revision so the generated inputs cannot be stale.

Every compile also writes `<cache-dir>/assets.json`, a deterministic report of
text, JSON, file-loader, WASM, and explicitly embedded assets. It records the
packaged handle, project-relative source origin, byte size, SHA-256 digest, and
the generating asset module where applicable.

> **Note**
> `node:fs` consults the embedded registry *before* disk, and a bare
> embed-relative key matches too — so `readFileSync("dist/index.html")` returns
> the **embedded** bytes even if a `dist/index.html` exists on disk next to the
> binary. Read a real on-disk file by absolute path, and use the explicit
> `$perryfs/<path>` form when you specifically mean the embedded copy.
>
> Embedding supports host builds on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Windows uses
> LLVM clang to emit a COFF registration object; set `PERRY_LLVM_CLANG` when
> the matching clang is not first on `PATH`. Cross-target embedding is not
> currently supported.

## Debug Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--print-hir` | Print HIR (intermediate representation) to stdout |
| `--trace <STAGES>` | Dump IR at one or more pipeline stages. Comma-separated: `hir` (post-transform HIR), `llvm` (per-module `.ll` into `.perry-trace/llvm/`), or `all` |
| `--focus <NAME>` | Restrict `--trace hir` to functions/methods/classes whose name contains `NAME`, suppressing import/export/init noise. Implies `--trace hir` if no stage is given |
| `--no-link` | Produce `.o` object file(s) only, skip linking. The objects are written to `-o` — verbatim for a single-module program, otherwise into `-o`'s directory under module-derived names, since one `-o` cannot name several files. With no `-o` they land in the current directory. Each path is printed as `Wrote object file: <path>` |
| `--no-codegen` | Skip the `package.json` `perry.codegen` build-time steps (also `PERRY_SKIP_CODEGEN=1`). See [Project Configuration](../getting-started/project-config.md) |
| `--keep-intermediates` | Keep `.o` and `.asm` intermediate files |
| `--debug-symbols` | Retain symbols/DWARF (and emit a Windows PDB) instead of stripping the result. |
| `--no-cache` | Disable the per-module object cache for this build; also `PERRY_NO_CACHE=1`. |
| `--cache-dir <PATH>` | Override the machine-local cache root; see [Cache Directory](cache-dir.md). |
| `--verify-native-regions` | Run native-representation lowering invariants and force codegen instead of cache reuse. |
| `--disable-buffer-fast-path` | Disable native Buffer/Uint8Array load/store lowering for A/B diagnosis. |
| `--explain-lowering` | Emit a type-lowering evidence report; implies native-region verification. |
| `--opt-report[=json]` | Report which values Perry could **not** statically type, why, and whether you can fix it. Text by default; `--opt-report=json` emits a stable schema for tooling. Also settable via `PERRY_OPT_REPORT=1` |
| `--statepoint-report[=json]` | Report native-stack GC root pressure: calls with live roots, audited non-collecting calls omitted, relocations, plain-map fallbacks, and live-root widths. Research-only; requires `PERRY_RS4GC=1`, the one native-root backend (the plain stack-map and explicit-bridge modes it also named are gone) |

The `--trace`/`--focus` pair localizes "compiled to the wrong thing" bugs:
`perry compile foo.ts --trace hir,llvm --focus parseRow` dumps just the
`parseRow` function's lowered HIR and the module's LLVM IR, so you can see
which stage corrupted it without scrolling a full-module dump. `--trace llvm`
forces a full recompile (the object cache otherwise skips codegen for
unchanged modules, leaving the trace dir empty).

### `--opt-report` — why a value stayed boxed

Perry's speed comes from proving static types and selecting unboxed
representations (see the
[representation-selection RFC](https://github.com/PerryTS/perry/blob/main/docs/representation-selection-rfc.md)).
When a proof fails the value stays NaN-boxed and the fast paths silently do
not fire. `--opt-report` is the representation-selection analogue of LLVM's
`-Rpass-missed` remarks: it prints what was proven, what was not, and which
rule made the call.

```console
$ perry compile batch.ts -o batch --opt-report
Representation summary
----------------------
  Ptr<Shape>          0 selected /    4 denied   (0% of 4 candidates)
  I32/U32/Str         3 selected /    0 denied   (100% of 3 candidates)
  specialized ABI     0 selected /    3 denied   (0% of 3 candidates)
  TOTAL            3 values unboxed, 7 left Boxed

*** Ptr<Shape> promoted 0 of 4 candidates in this build. ***
    Every candidate was denied; the rules are in collectors/ptr_shape.rs.
...
  batch.ts :: local `acc` [loop depth 0]
      in function totalsRow -> Boxed
      ptr-shape rule 2 (containment)
      returned from this function. Return positions do not carry a shape
      fact yet, so returning a record forfeits its proof.
```

Each denied value carries:

- **Position** — `local`, `param`, `return`, `field`, or `alloc-site` (an
  object literal that is never bound to a local, the `.map(x => ({...}))`
  idiom).
- **The rule that denied it**, in the collector's own numbering, so you can
  check it against the named source file.
- **An actionability tier**: *Fixable in your source* (stop reassigning it,
  don't capture it in a closure), *Inherently polymorphic* (correctly boxed —
  no action), or *Perry limitation* (not your code; names the tracking issue
  where one exists).
- **A hotness proxy.** Loop-nesting depth **and**, separately, whether the
  enclosing region is an iterating builtin's callback. The two are reported
  as distinct columns on purpose: a `map`/`sort`/`reduce` callback has no
  loop of its own but runs once per element, so loop depth alone ranks it
  last. Neither is a profile — they are static proxies.

Wins are reported alongside the misses, so the ratio is visible rather than
just the complaints.

**It is observational only** — emitted code is byte-identical with the flag
on and off. Like `--trace llvm`, it disables build and object cache reuse for
its own run, because a cache hit skips codegen entirely and there would be
nothing to report. The report goes to **stderr**, so it never mixes into a
`--format json` payload or your program's piped output.

Values are identified by **function and binding name**: Perry's HIR keeps
names through lowering but drops source positions, so there is no `file:line`
yet. `--opt-report=json` carries the same data under `schema_version: 1`;
diffing two builds' JSON is a cheap CI check against a representation
silently regressing to zero.

## Output Optimization

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--minify` | Minify and obfuscate output (auto-enabled for `--target web`) |
| `--march <CPU>` | CPU baseline for the generated machine code: an LLVM CPU name (`x86-64-v2`, `x86-64-v3`, `znver2`, `apple-m1`, …), `native` (tune to the build machine — the default for host builds), or `generic` (the target architecture's portable baseline — the default for cross builds). Pin this when the binary runs on other machines: a host-native build on an AVX-512 box otherwise SIGILLs on older x86-64 CPUs. Also settable via `PERRY_TARGET_CPU` or perry.toml `[build] march`; `[build] native_tuning = false` is shorthand for `generic`. Applies to app code and the auto-optimized runtime/stdlib rebuild. |
| `--features <LIST>` | Define comma-separated compile-time `__feature_NAME__` constants for dead-code elimination. |
| `--no-auto-optimize` | Use the prebuilt full runtime/stdlib instead of rebuilding the smallest reachable feature set. |
| `--fast-math` | Permit floating-point reassociation; see [Fast-math](fast-math.md). |
| `--fp-contract off\|on\|fast` | Control fused multiply-add contraction separately from reassociation. |

Minification strips comments, collapses whitespace, and mangles local variable/parameter/non-exported function names for smaller output.

### Size-optimized builds

For the smallest possible native binaries, two opt-in environment variables
rebuild the auto-optimized runtime/stdlib archives tuned for size instead of
speed (they require a Perry workspace checkout, like the rest of
auto-optimize):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PERRY_SIZE_OPT=z` (or `s`) | Rebuild the runtime/stdlib at `-C opt-level=z`/`s` instead of `3`. Roughly halves a small program's binary at some runtime-speed cost (compute-heavy inner loops can run ~2-3× slower). Size-optimized and normal archives are cached independently. |
| `PERRY_SIZE_LTO=fat` | Additionally run whole-archive fat LTO over the rebuilt archives (slower rebuild, smaller binary). Only meaningful together with `PERRY_SIZE_OPT`. |
| `PERRY_SIZE_PANIC=abort-immediate` | Additionally rebuild the Rust standard library with the `immediate-abort` panic strategy when auto-optimize proves that no UI/thread/plugin callback needs unwinding, removing the backtrace symbolizer and unwind tables (~314 KB measured). Requires a nightly toolchain (`-Zbuild-std`); only meaningful together with `PERRY_SIZE_OPT`. A Rust-level internal panic then aborts without a symbolized backtrace — JS `throw`/`catch`, `finally`, error stacks and `uncaughtException` are unaffected. |

A `console.log` hello world on macOS arm64: 4.03 MB default → 2.17 MB with
`PERRY_SIZE_OPT=z PERRY_SIZE_LTO=fat` → 1.87 MB adding
`PERRY_SIZE_PANIC=abort-immediate`. Programs that use more of the runtime
shrink less, proportionally.

## Testing Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--enable-geisterhand` | Embed the [Geisterhand](../testing/geisterhand.md) HTTP server for programmatic UI testing (default port 7676) |
| `--geisterhand-port <PORT>` | Set a custom port for the Geisterhand server (implies `--enable-geisterhand`) |

## Runtime Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--enable-js-runtime` | Enable V8 JavaScript runtime for unsupported npm packages |
| `--enable-wasm-runtime` | Force-link the wasmi WebAssembly host runtime (auto-detected when `WebAssembly.*` is referenced; needed only when loading via dlopen / FFI without a static reference) |
| `--type-check` | Enable type checking via tsgo IPC |
| `--strict-eval` | Fail the build if any runtime-unknown `eval(...)` / `new Function(<dynamic body>)` site is reachable. By default such a site is compiled to a deferred runtime error (throws only if reached) and a compile-time notice is printed. Also settable via `perry.eval = "error"` / `perry.strict = true` (package.json or perry.toml). `PERRY_ALLOW_EVAL=1` forces it off. See [Limitations](../language/limitations.md#no-eval-or-dynamic-code). |
| `--strict-dynamic-import` | Fail the build if a dynamic `import(...)` has a runtime-computed (non-resolvable) specifier. By default such a site is compiled to a rejected `Promise` that throws a descriptive `Error` only if reached, and is listed in the same end-of-build notice as deferred eval sites. Also settable via `perry.dynamicImport = "error"` / `perry.strict = true` (package.json or perry.toml). `PERRY_ALLOW_EVAL=1` forces it off. Resolvable forms (string literals, ternaries of resolvable arms, template literals over const locals, finite union-typed params, glob) are unaffected. See [Limitations](../language/limitations.md#no-eval-or-dynamic-code). |
| `--strict-unimplemented` | Fail at compile time when a recognized but unimplemented Node/stdlib API is referenced instead of emitting a deferred runtime error. |
| `--emit-attest` | Emit `<binary>.attest.json`; see [Binary attestation](emit-attest.md). |
| `--emit-sandbox` | Emit the platform sandbox sidecar; see [Sandbox profiles](emit-sandbox.md). |
| `--lockdown` | Refuse reachable arbitrary-code-execution surfaces; see [Lockdown](lockdown.md). |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PERRY_LICENSE_KEY` | Perry Hub license key for `perry publish` |
| `PERRY_APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for .p12 certificate |
| `PERRY_TARGET_CPU` | CPU baseline for generated machine code (same values as `--march`; the flag and perry.toml `[build] march` win over the env var) |
| `PERRY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` | Disable automatic update checks |
| `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` | The same, using the ecosystem-wide spelling |
| `PERRY_UPDATE_MODE` | `off`/`notify`/`prompt`/`auto` for one run — see [Updates](updates.md) |
| `PERRY_UPDATE_SERVER` | Custom update server URL |
| `CI=true` | Auto-skip update checks (set by most CI systems) |
| `RUST_LOG` | Debug logging level (`debug`, `info`, `trace`) |
| `PERRY_OPT_REPORT` | `1`/`text` or `json` — same as `--opt-report[=json]`, for driving the report from an environment where adding a flag is awkward |

The native-stack GC root-pressure report has **no** environment spelling: use
`--statepoint-report[=json]`. The `PERRY_STATEPOINT_REPORT` variable is set by
the driver to carry that flag to the codegen workers and is not read as user
input — it was a fifth GC env knob with no CI arm, and was deleted under
CLAUDE.md's GC knob kill policy.

## Typed-feedback profile replay

`--typed-feedback-profile <path>` supplies an **advisory** profile to native LLVM
lowering. Default builds do not read a profile. The first supported observation,
`numeric_array_element`, can select the existing guarded numeric-array read at
an otherwise generic checked `array[index]` site. Already specialized reads and
other site/observation kinds are ignored and explained.

Capture a workload, then replay it with the **same compiler executable, source,
target and lowering options**:

```bash
PERRY_TYPED_FEEDBACK=1 perry compile app.ts -o app-capture \
  --typed-feedback-sites typed-feedback-sites.json
PERRY_TYPED_FEEDBACK_TRACE=typed-feedback-trace.json ./app-capture
python3 scripts/typed-feedback-profile.py \
  --sites typed-feedback-sites.json --trace typed-feedback-trace.json \
  -o typed-feedback-profile.json
perry compile app.ts -o app \
  --typed-feedback-profile typed-feedback-profile.json --explain-lowering
```

The conversion utility is in the Perry source checkout. Pair the catalog with
the trace from that exact capture build. It retains only observed numeric array
reads and excludes runtime addresses, shape IDs and method identities. A trace
without supported observations produces a diagnostic instead of an empty profile.
The capture build must enable `PERRY_TYPED_FEEDBACK` at compile time; enabling it
only when running a normal binary cannot restore omitted instrumentation.

The JSON replay schema is version 1:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "compiler": "sha256:<exact compiler executable hash>",
  "modules": [{
    "identity": {
      "module": "app.ts",
      "source_hash": "sha256:<source bytes hash>",
      "hir_hash": "<stable post-transform HIR hash>",
      "lowering_hash": "<compiler lowering-input fingerprint>",
      "target": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
    },
    "sites": [{
      "site_id": 123,
      "function": "perry_fn_app_ts__read",
      "kind": "array_element",
      "operation": "array[index]",
      "observation_kind": "numeric_array_element"
    }]
  }]
}
```

Use generated identities, rather than copying this illustrative site ID. Site
IDs identify deterministic lowering sites within an exact module/compiler/input
combination; function, kind and operation must also match. The lowering hash
includes target CPU/features, codegen settings and imported capabilities using
the object cache's complete input fingerprint. Capture instrumentation and
native-region reporting/verification are excluded so they can vary during replay.
Even a comment-only source change invalidates the source hash, and rebuilding
Perry invalidates the compiler hash without needing a version bump. No
cross-version or best-effort stale replay is attempted.

Malformed or unreadable explicit input is a compilation error naming the profile
and how to create it. Well-formed schema/compiler/target/source/HIR/options
mismatches, unknown modules/sites, duplicate identities and unsupported
observations are ignored for specialization. Each rejected fact is reported on
stderr with its reason. Accepted and rejected facts also appear in native-rep
artifacts (`PERRY_NATIVE_REPS=1`) and `--explain-lowering`'s typed-path evidence and
reason counts. Replay and catalog builds bypass build/object cache reuse to
produce evidence from this compilation. Artifact filenames and report paths have
run-specific nonces; decisions and lowering are deterministic for identical inputs.

Profiles and TypeScript annotations never authorize an unchecked operation.
Every replay-selected read rechecks the live receiver, array representation,
descriptors/prototype state and bounds with the existing numeric-array runtime
guard. Strings, holes, changed layouts, non-array receivers and other guard
failures use the original boxed JavaScript fallback, with no added number
coercion. Replay does not relax ownership, alias, lifetime or method-identity
checks. Native-region verification requires a consumed fresh replay fact,
a matching runtime guard and an explicit fallback/materialization record for
every claimed profile selection.

## Unused re-export collection

Collection prunes unused `export { name } from`, `export * from`, and namespace
re-export edges by default when the exporting package declares the file free
of side effects and every static dependency of the omitted target has the same
guarantee. Perry honors `sideEffects: false` and arrays of `*`, `**`, and `?`
globs. Unsupported patterns, missing contracts, CommonJS, unresolved dependencies,
and cyclic static dependency trees conservatively retain the edge. Keeping cycles
preserves initialization order even when exported variables read each other.
This pass does not remove direct
imports used by module code or individual declarations. An `import { x }; export { x }`
pair is first normalized to a re-export only in barrels whose runtime imports
are all named bindings forwarded through local export lists, and whose entire
static dependency tree has side-effect-free contracts. Moving the complete
import group preserves dependency order in cycles. Mixed barrels retain their imports.
Imports with attributes, nonstandard phases, or package aliases retain their original resolution.
Namespace and dynamic imports retain the
complete exported surface, and existing dynamic initialization stays deferred.

Set `PERRY_NO_REEXPORT_PRUNE=1` to disable this collection pass for an A/B build.
The compile summary reports unique omitted modules in the proven static
dependency trees, excluding modules retained by another importer.

Set `PERRY_COLLECT_ONLY=1` to stop after collection and write `<cache-dir>/audit.json`
and `module-graph.json` (paths, eager/deferred initialization, and pruned count)
without generating objects or linking an executable. This mode bypasses the
finished-build cache and runs normal collection/preflight checks. For example:

```sh
PERRY_COLLECT_ONLY=1 perry compile src/index.ts --cache-dir /tmp/graph-after
PERRY_COLLECT_ONLY=1 PERRY_NO_REEXPORT_PRUNE=1 perry compile src/index.ts --cache-dir /tmp/graph-before
```
