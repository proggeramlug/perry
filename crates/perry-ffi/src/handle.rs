//! Handle registry — opaque integer IDs for Rust objects that
//! survive across the FFI boundary (added in v0.5.x of the
//! perry-ffi v0.5 surface — non-breaking; pure additions).
//!
//! Most non-trivial wrappers (mysql2 connection pools, ws clients,
//! ioredis pipelines, even simple ones like lru-cache) need to
//! hand a long-lived Rust object to TypeScript and get it back
//! later. We can't pass Rust ownership directly across `extern "C"`
//! — the runtime can't drop a `Box<MyType>` because it doesn't know
//! `MyType`'s vtable. Instead we register the object in a global
//! [`DashMap`], return a small integer handle to TypeScript, and
//! every method call comes back through the FFI with the handle
//! plus a type-aware downcast.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Single process-wide [`DashMap`] keyed by [`Handle`] (a `i64`).
//! A fresh `i64` is allocated atomically from a counter starting at
//! 1 — `0` is reserved as `INVALID_HANDLE` so `register_handle` can
//! never produce a falsy value (matches JS truthiness semantics
//! for type checks like `if (handle)`). Visible ids stop before
//! `0x40000`; the pointer-tagged small-handle band above that is
//! reserved for Web Fetch and proxy handles.
//!
//! Ids freed by [`drop_handle`] / [`take_handle`] are parked on a
//! bounded freelist and handed back out by [`register_handle`]
//! before the counter advances, so a handle-per-request workload
//! consumes ids in proportion to its *concurrent* live count rather
//! than its *cumulative* allocation count — while reclaimed ids fit
//! within the bounded freelist. Frees beyond [`FREE_HANDLES_CAP`]
//! are intentionally discarded, so a burst larger than the cap can
//! still advance [`NEXT_HANDLE`] and consume fresh ids. Ids are
//! therefore reused over time but a given id is unique among the
//! handles live at any instant — a recycled id is only parked after
//! its prior entry was removed from the map.
//!
//! A freed id is NOT reusable the instant it is freed: it first sits
//! in a quarantine and is promoted to the freelist only by
//! [`drain_quarantined_handles`], which the host event loop calls
//! once per tick. This deferral closes an ABA / use-after-recycle
//! hazard — a consumer holding a stale bare id (e.g. an HTTP handler's
//! `res` after the response was finalized) would otherwise see its id
//! re-occupied by the next registration within the same tick and
//! silently mutate a different object. See [`QUARANTINED_HANDLES`].
//!
//! perry-stdlib has its own copy of this same registry (in
//! `crates/perry-stdlib/src/common/handle.rs`). They are separate
//! integer spaces — perry-ffi-allocated handles cannot be looked
//! up via perry-stdlib's `get_handle`, and vice versa. Programs
//! that link both registries (e.g. via the well-known flip) just
//! end up with two `DashMap` statics; each wrapper consults the
//! registry it was compiled against. Values returned to JS can still collide
//! at the runtime dispatch layer if two subsystems expose the same
//! `POINTER_TAG | id` bits, so handle families that participate in generic
//! property/method dispatch reserve disjoint visible id ranges.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! [`get_handle`] / [`get_handle_mut`] return `'static` references
//! by exploiting the fact that DashMap entries are stable while
//! they exist. The caller must not drop the handle (via
//! [`take_handle`] / [`drop_handle`]) while a borrow is live.
//! Single-threaded FFI usage — the typical pattern — has no
//! aliasing problem; multi-threaded wrappers should use
//! [`with_handle`] which scopes the borrow under a closure.

/// The visible handle is a bare integer with no generation/epoch (the i64 ABI

/// consumer that resolves an object purely by id therefore cannot distinguish
/// "the object I was given" from "a *different* object that happens to occupy
/// the same recycled id now." `perry-ext-http` hits this: a request
/// handler can return before `res.end()`, leaving a stale JS-side `res` value
/// (a bare tagged id) outstanding; once that request is finalized its id is
/// freed. If the id were recycled *immediately*, the very next
/// [`register_handle`] (e.g. the next incoming request's response) would
/// re-occupy it, and a late `res.write`/`res.end` from the retired handler
/// would resolve the id to — and mutate — the *new* request's response,
/// bleeding one request's body into another's. Before the freelist existed a
/// freed id stayed dead, so such a stale write was a safe no-op; the freelist
/// removed that safety. The quarantine restores it.
///
/// A freed id is parked here first and only promoted to [`FREE_HANDLES`] by
/// [`drain_quarantined_handles`], which the host event loop calls once per
/// pump tick. One full tick covers the dominant case: a stale `res.*` that the
/// retired handler defers via a microtask or a same-turn continuation runs
/// before the next tick's drain, and while the id sits in quarantine it maps
/// to nothing in [`HANDLES`], so that stale call re-fetches an empty slot and
/// no-ops (exactly the pre-freelist behavior) instead of corrupting a live
/// object.
///
/// # The two quarantine tiers
///
/// The one-tick window only covers ids whose owner is *provably done writing*
/// at free time — an HTTP response that reached `res.end()` (its
/// `writable_ended` is set, so any further `res.write`/`res.end` is a no-op the
/// caller can't ride into a recycled object). For those, one tick is enough:
/// the stale call spends itself against an empty slot on the same turn.
///
/// But a response can be finalized *without* ever ending — the HTTP reaper
/// frees a parked request's handles when its peer disconnects, or when the
/// owning server is force-closed, neither of which sets `writable_ended`. The
/// handler is still suspended on a slow `await`/`fetch` and may resume many
/// ticks later and call `res.write`. A one-tick quarantine would have promoted
/// (and possibly re-minted) that id long before, so the late write would land
/// on a *live* response — silent cross-request body corruption that is NOT a
/// write-after-end (the handler never called `end()`, so nothing rejects it).
///
/// For that case the id goes into [`QUARANTINED_UNTIL`] with a *deadline*
/// instead — the request's grace deadline, which the reaper already tracks
/// (Node's `requestTimeout`, default ~300s). The id is held until that deadline
/// passes, by which point the request is definitively dead: a handler that
/// resumes within grace finds its id still parked (the write no-ops against an
/// empty slot); once the deadline elapses no legitimate resume can write, so
/// the id is safe to recycle. This closes the window for arbitrarily-long-async
/// handlers without a per-handle generation (which the fixed i64 ABI forbids).
///
/// Bound: the deadline-gated quarantine holds at most one id per response per
/// in-flight grace window — the same population the reaper's `IN_FLIGHT` list
/// already bounds — and is capped at [`FREE_HANDLES_CAP`] like every other
/// tier, so it cannot grow without limit.
