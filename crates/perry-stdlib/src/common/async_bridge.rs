//! Async bridge: connects Rust async (tokio) with the perry Promise system.
//!
//! The perry runtime has a Promise implementation that expects synchronous
//! resolution callbacks. We need to bridge this with tokio's async runtime
//! for database operations.
//!
//! IMPORTANT: perry-runtime uses thread-local arenas for memory allocation.
//! This means JSValue objects created on tokio worker threads will be allocated
//! from a different arena than the main thread, causing memory corruption.
//!
//! To avoid this, async operations should:
//! 1. NOT create JSValue objects (arrays, strings, objects) in async blocks
//! 2. Store raw Rust data and use deferred conversion callbacks
//! 3. The conversion callbacks run on the main thread during js_stdlib_process_pending
