//! The miss entry of the generated static-key store (`o.k = v`).
//!
//! # What the emitted hit path proves, and what this entry must therefore publish
//!
//! `perry-codegen/src/expr/put_value_store_ic.rs` emits ONE inline hit for an
//! existing own data property: a receiver-tag test, one compare of the
//! receiver's ShapeId word against the low half of the site's compact word
//! (`@perry_ic_N_packed_set`), the per-object receiver-kind test, and a store
//! at the slot the word's high half names. Every other case calls this entry.
//!
//! The word is a MEMO of a pure function of one ShapeId: "key `k` is an own,
//! writable data property of every receiver carrying ShapeId `S`, at inline
//! slot `s`". It never duplicates mutable shape data, because nothing about
//! `S` is mutable: ShapeIds are process-unique and never reused, and a
//! receiver whose keys, descriptors or integrity level change is re-stamped
//! with a different id. So the word cannot go stale; a receiver that no longer
//! satisfies it simply carries a different id and misses. This is the same
//! device, and the same argument, as the read path's `@perry_ic_N_packed_get`
//! (`field_get_set/ic_miss/packed_get.rs`).
//!
//! What has to be true of `S` for the publication to be sound is therefore a
//! property of the SHAPE, established here once, at prime time, from a live
//! receiver that carries it:
//!
//! * **own, inline, at slot `s`** — the key is found in the shape's own key
//!   list below its logical count, at an index below `live_inline_slot_count`.
//!   Spill-located keys are never published to the word (they keep the
//!   runtime-validated ways below).
//! * **a data property, writable** — charter step 3: a key's attributes live
//!   with the key, in the keys array the shape names (`key_attrs.rs`), so
//!   the key's entry, vetted here, holds for every carrier of `S`. Every
//!   descriptor install, removal or bulk clear changes the keys and with them
//!   the ShapeId.
//! * **integrity** — `Object.freeze` makes every key non-writable (refused
//!   above per key), and every integrity change mints a counter-unique
//!   semantic generation, so a sealed or non-extensible receiver's writable
//!   key may be published: an overwrite is not an add.
//! * **not a class object, not a dictionary** — both are the shape's
//!   `object_kind` (`object_is_regular`).
//!
//! * **receiver kind and numeric proof** (charter step 3) — the receiver-kind
//!   admission (a native-module receiver, and a class-less receiver that no
//!   birth site marked ordinary: `URL`, `Object.prototype`, the typed-array
//!   prototypes) and the Array-subclass numeric proof are shape kinds
//!   (`object::shapes::store_kind`): only an `Ordinary` shape is published,
//!   and `Ordinary` proves both. The emitted hit reads nothing else.
//!
//! # Polymorphic sites
//!
//! The word holds the most recently PRIMED shape. The site's lazily allocated
//! way cache (`@perry_ic_N`, a [`PackedSetWays`]) holds up to eight more, in
//! the word's own format: ways 0..4 are compared by the emitted code right
//! after a word miss (the read path's structure, #7753), ways 4..8 by this
//! entry, which then stores without the full `[[Set]]` walk. A spill-located
//! key's way holds its ShapeId with `PACKED_SPILL_FLIP` flipped into it, so no
//! emitted compare can match it, and this entry serves it through the audited
//! overflow store. Ways are filled in order and never evicted, so a site with
//! more than eight stable shapes settles instead of cycling its entries, and a
//! way hit never rewrites the word.
