//! Young-entry logs: per-side-table remembered sets for the copying minor
//! and the budgeted minor-only trace.
//!
//! # The problem this solves
//!
//! Every registered mutable-root scanner walks its whole table on every
//! collection. On the compiled claude-code TUI that is ~35k shape families,
//! ~120k descriptors and ~13k closure-prop owners per walk, three walks per
//! copying minor and two per budgeted minor (initial root scan + final
//! remark), 41+ minors per streamed reply — and every one of those walks found
//! `slots=0`: 34–56 ms per minor of scanner time discovering that nothing in
//! the table pointed at the nursery (`[gc-scanner-profile]`, 2026-09-04).
//!
//! The previous attempt (2026-09-01, reverted) skipped a walk when the
//! VISITOR was inert. That is unsound for the three expensive tables: they
//! ROOT (`visit_nanbox_u64_slot` on accessor get/set, `visit_nanbox_f64_slot`
//! on closure prop values, `visit_usize_slot` on carried keys arrays), and
//! rooting marks in Mark/Copy, so skipping drops live objects.
//!
//! # What a minor can act on
//!
//! A minor-scoped pass — the copying minor's preflight/mark/rewrite passes and
//! the budgeted cycle's `GcCollectionKind::Minor` root scan — neither moves
//! nor sweeps an OLD-generation object. `CopyingNurseryCollector::mark_addr`
//! returns an old address unchanged; `rewrite_raw_addr` follows forwarding
//! records that only a moved (young) object can carry; a minor-only trace's
//! marks on old headers are consumed by nothing (the minor sweep frees young
//! objects only, `PostTraceProbe::owner_is_dead` refuses old owners, and the
//! full path's remembered-set rebuild does not run for minors). So an entry
//! whose key AND every value are old is a provable no-op for every
//! minor-scoped visit. The set of addresses a minor CAN act on is the
//! complement: nursery, longlived (traced through, never swept, not barriered —
//! `barrier_parent_needs_remembering` is false for it) and malloc-GC objects
//! (swept by minors). [`addr_is_minor_relevant`] is that predicate.
//!
//! # The log
//!
//! [`YoungLog`] holds the KEYS of entries that may hold a minor-relevant
//! pointer. It is a log, not an index: duplicates and stale keys are allowed
//! (a stale key is a lookup miss and is dropped; a duplicate is visited twice,
//! idempotently). A minor-scoped scanner walks only the logged keys, visits
//! each entry exactly as the full walk would, and re-logs the entry iff it is
//! still relevant after the visit (a to-space survivor stays young; a promoted
//! object is old and drops out). A full-scope scanner walks the whole table as
//! before and REBUILDS the log from what it found.
//!
//! # The three rules (from `perry-young-gc-fixed-cost.md`)
//!
//! 1. **Arm before publish.** Every writer notes the key BEFORE the entry
//!    becomes findable. A note is one page-map probe (`classify_heap_generation`,
//!    hot-TLS cached) per pointer; an old key with old values notes nothing.
//! 2. **Machine-check the writer set.** Under `debug_assertions` a minor-scoped
//!    walk first re-derives the relevant set from the authoritative table and
//!    panics on any relevant entry the log does not name
//!    ([`debug_assert_logged`]). The `gc/tests` copying-minor fixtures run this
//!    on every collection, so deleting one `note` site is a red test, not a
//!    silent leak.
//! 3. **A skip needs a counter.** [`note_walk`] records, per walk, how many
//!    entries the log named, how many were visited, how many stayed relevant
//!    and how big the table was; `[gc-young-log]` prints them per collection
//!    under `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1`, and the tests read them back.
//!
//! Thread model: the shape and descriptor tables are agent-local
//! (`state()`), so their logs live beside them. The closure side tables are
//! process-global mutexed maps; their log is thread-local on purpose — an
//! entry's addresses belong to the heap of the thread that inserted it, and
//! only that thread's minors can act on them, so a foreign thread's walk must
//! neither visit nor drop them.
