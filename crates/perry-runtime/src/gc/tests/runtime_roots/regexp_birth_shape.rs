//! #12313: the RegExp birth shape is one ShapeId for the agent's life.
//!
//! `regex::instance` memoizes the birth ShapeId as a scalar and re-stamps it
//! on every birth. Before the fix, a synchronous full trace that found no live
//! RegExp retired that record, so the next birth re-minted the same facts
//! under a NEW id and every compiled `lastIndex` read site saw one more shape
//! per collection. The record is now an external carrier, like every other
//! agent-lifetime intrinsic birth memo.
//!
//! A record that outlives its last receiver still names heap words: its keys
//! and its identity's [[Prototype]] word. The second test moves the prototype
//! with no RegExp alive and checks that the word followed it; the shape table
//! scanner visits both kinds of word (`shapes::scan_shape_table_rekey_mut`).
