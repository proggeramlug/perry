//! Software prefetch for the collector's pointer-chasing loops.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! On a promotion-heavy workload the copying minor's cost is not arithmetic,
//! it is DRAM latency over object headers. `gc-handoff/bench/retain.ts` keeps
//! 3 M records live; a single minor promotes ~750 k of them and touches each
//! header from three separate passes — the remembered-set dirty scan (which
//! classifies the child address), the mark drain (which re-reads the header to
//! walk its slots), and `clear_marks`. Between passes the cohort is ~54 MB, so
//! every pass starts cold and each header read is a full memory round trip.
//!
//! All three loops know their next targets several iterations ahead: the drain
//! and `clear_marks` walk a `Vec<*mut GcHeader>`, and the dirty scan walks a
//! contiguous slot range whose values decode to the addresses it is about to
//! classify. Issuing a prefetch for the entry `PREFETCH_DISTANCE` ahead
//! overlaps those round trips instead of serialising them.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! `prfm` / `_mm_prefetch` are architecturally faultless: an unmapped,
//! misaligned or nonsensical address is a no-op, never a signal. That is what
//! makes it usable on a *candidate* address (the dirty scan prefetches slot
//! values before they have been proven to be pointers) where a speculative
//! load would be a use-after-free waiting to happen.

/// How far ahead the collector's loops prefetch.
///
/// Deliberately modest: the loops do real work per element (a classify, a slot
/// walk), so the latency to hide is one DRAM access, not many. Too large a
/// distance evicts the line before it is used.
