//! Conservative native-stack scan mode: how a collection decides whether to
//! walk this thread's native (Rust) stack looking for anything that might be a
//! heap pointer.
//!
//! Split out of `roots.rs` in #7148 — that file crossed the 2,000-line gate,
//! and this is the topically self-contained piece: the mode enum, its env/
//! override precedence, the `ManualGcScanGuard` that pins `Full` for one
//! collection, and the decision the mark phase consults. Nothing else in
//! `roots.rs` reads its internals.
//!
//! ★ The decision this module returns is the single most expensive bit in the
//! collector. `Scan` makes the copying minor ineligible
//! (`CopiedMinorFallbackReason::ConservativeStack`), so a cycle that takes it
//! runs no copying minor at all — measured at `heap_used_bytes` +364%..+5371%
//! and `minor_cycles` → 0 on all eight `gc_ratchet` probes. See
//! `super::super::scan_fallback` for the census of who asks for it.

    // rather than the shadow stack, so the conservative scan was what kept them
    // alive. That is a description of how some tests were written, not a
    // requirement of testing, and it had a cost that outweighed the
    // convenience: it made the test build a DIFFERENT GC configuration from
    // production. A missing precise root — the #7055 shape — was rescued by the
    // native scan under test and was a live wrong answer in production, so the
    // suite filtered out precisely the failure class it exists to catch. It
    // also made the copying minor ineligible under test
    // (`CopiedMinorFallbackReason::ConservativeStack`), so relocation was
    // largely unexercised.
    //
    // The correct mechanism already existed and the tests already used it:
    // `RuntimeHandleScope` / `gc_temp_root_*`, plus the isolation guards, which
    // pin `Auto` themselves — 351 of the 531 gc tests were already running this
    // way. Flipping the default cost exactly one test conversion
    // (`test_minor_preserves_old_to_young_edge_across_minors`, which read a
    // relocated child through a stale pre-collection local).
    //
    // A test that needs the scan *provably* off — not merely resolved off by
    // today's `Auto` policy — should pin `ConservativeScanDisabledGuard`.
