//! Death pruning for object-ADDRESS-keyed side tables (2026-07-09 GC audit,
//! wave 2 batch B).
//!
//! Nineteen runtime side tables are keyed by the raw address of an owning heap
//! object (descriptor tables, symbol-keyed properties and accessors, closure
//! dynamic props, arguments metadata, recorded prototypes, exotic expandos,
//! array expandos and iterator brands, the shape and transition caches,
//! synthetic class ids, console instances, boxed-primitive payloads,
//! reflect-metadata targets, `node:vm` metadata, fs FileHandle fds) — see
//! [`DEAD_KEY_PRUNES`], which is the authoritative list.
//! The owning GC types mostly have no
//! finalize hook, so nothing told those tables when the owner died: entries —
//! and any strongly-rooted values inside them (accessor closures, symbol
//! property values, expando values) — leaked forever, and a NEW object
//! allocated at the recycled address inherited the dead owner's entries (the
//! ABA hazard behind e.g. "read-only property" errors on fresh objects).
//!
//! ★ #8174 — WHY THE LIST IS A REGISTRY NOW. For a table that is REKEYED
//! rather than re-derived (its key slot is rewritten in place by
//! `RuntimeRootVisitor::visit_metadata_*`), a missing prune is not a leak. The
//! arena recycles the dead key's address, the recycled bytes are read as a
//! `GcHeader`, and a coincidental `GC_FLAG_FORWARDED` byte makes the next
//! cycle's rewrite pass follow a garbage forwarding pointer — #8040, which cost
//! days to trace back from a `TypeError: value is not a function` in an
//! unrelated function. #8168 wired up the one table that had been missed, and
//! nothing was checking for the next one. [`DEAD_KEY_PRUNES`] below is the list
//! `fan_out` iterates, and `scripts/gc_rekeyed_key_tables.py` reads it: every
//! rekey site in the tree needs a written verdict in
//! `scripts/gc_rekeyed_key_tables.json`, a `dead_owner:` verdict must name a
//! prune that is actually in this array, and an exemption that matches nothing
//! fails too. Adding a rekeyed table without a prune is now a build failure.
//!
//! Note the ORDER on the copying minor: the rewrite pass runs BEFORE this
//! prune (`copying.rs` rewrites, then
//! `finalize_dead_copied_minor_from_space_side_allocations` prunes). A prune
//! therefore protects the NEXT cycle, which is sound only because the address
//! is not recycled until `copying_reset_from_spaces_and_flip`, strictly later
//! still.
//!
//! This module supplies the two deadness predicates and the fan-out passes,
//! mirroring the proven Map/Set pattern (`map.rs`:
//! `collect_dead_registered_maps_post_trace` /
//! `is_dead_copied_minor_from_space_map`):
//!
//! * [`prune_dead_owner_side_tables_post_trace`] runs at sweep entry of the
//!   non-copying cycle kinds (marks fresh, nothing freed or reallocated yet)
//!   — wired into `IncrementalSweepState::with_dead_collection_finalize`.
//! * [`prune_dead_owner_side_tables_copied_minor`] runs in the copied-minor
//!   fast path right before the from-space flip — wired into
//!   `finalize_dead_copied_minor_from_space_side_allocations`.
//!
//! Deadness rules (the audit's central caveat): a MINOR trace never marks
//! old-gen/malloc'd objects, so an unmarked header only proves death for an
//! untenured nursery object; everything else is only provably dead after a
//! FULL trace. Both predicates additionally require the owner address to be
//! attributable to THIS thread's heap (arena page classification or the
//! thread's malloc-tracked header list) before reading any header byte —
//! several of the pruned tables are process-global and can hold other
//! threads' heap addresses (whose mark bits this thread's trace says nothing
//! about), plus Box-leaked pseudo-objects (well-known symbols) with no
//! GcHeader at all. Unattributable owners are skipped: the residual leak
//! (entries owned by a foreign thread's dead objects, and owners already
//! freed by an earlier minor malloc sweep) is documented and bounded by
//! cross-thread usage.
