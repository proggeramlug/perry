//! Old-generation hole free list (#7437).
//!
//! Old-gen allocation was pure bump: a swept dead old object stayed dead
//! capacity until its *entire block* died, and a block with even one live
//! object never resets. A workload that promotes a large cohort and keeps
//! a scattered subset (every-64th node in the `12_large_live_set` ratchet
//! probe) therefore retained 105 MB of blocks for a ~1 MB live set — the
//! final full collection freed 87 MB of objects and reclaimed nothing,
//! because 49 of 50 blocks still held at least one live object. The same
//! mechanism is a large slice of tree.ts's old-gen churn high-water
//! (#7438): every dropped tree leaves holes in blocks pinned live by the
//! next tree's nodes.
//!
//! This module gives the old generation what the general arena has had
//! all along (`ARENA_FREE_LIST`): swept holes become reusable. Shape
//! differences are deliberate:
//!
//! - **Exact fit only, keyed by total (header-inclusive, padded) size.**
//!   The general list best-fits into larger slots and keeps the slot's
//!   original `GcHeader::size`, which is fine there because nothing else
//!   accounts those bytes. Old-gen promotion *does* account per-object
//!   sizes (`old_page_account_promoted_object`), so a reused slot must
//!   have exactly the size the caller asked for or the page live-byte
//!   accounting diverges from the header. Promoted cohorts are dominated
//!   by uniform class-instance sizes, so exact fit hits where the
//!   pathology lives.
//! - **Size-bucketed map, not a scanned Vec.** The pathological case has
//!   hundreds of thousands of holes; a per-allocation linear scan would
//!   put an O(holes) tax on every promotion.
//!
//! `OLD_ARENA_FREE_BYTES` tracks the total. It is deliberately NOT
//! subtracted from `OLD_GEN_IN_USE_BYTES` — that cache is defined (and
//! debug-asserted) as the sum of old block offsets, which hole reuse does
//! not change. Consumers that want old-generation pressure subtract
//! [`old_free_bytes`]. The live-allocation census used by
//! `process.memoryUsage().heapUsed` and major pacing excludes these holes at
//! collection time and observes later reuse through the decrease in this
//! counter; before this, dead-but-reusable bytes counted as pressure, so
//! reclaim kept re-firing full collections that could not lower the number it
//! was watching.
//!
//! Entries are only pushed for dead objects in blocks that still hold a
//! live object (fully-dead blocks go through block reclaim, which is
//! strictly better). A pushed entry's block can still die on a LATER
//! cycle, so every old-block reset/dealloc site must call
//! [`old_free_filter_range`] for the range it is about to recycle.
