//! Whole-block in-place promotion of the young generation (#7742).
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! The copying minor relocates every survivor object by object. Each move
//! costs a fresh old-gen allocation, a `memcpy`, a `layout_transfer`, per-object
//! old-page accounting, the `GcMoveHookKind` hooks, and a forwarding stub — and
//! then every referring slot has to be rewritten to the new address. That price
//! is worth paying when most of the nursery is garbage: the survivors are few
//! and compaction buys back the whole block.
//!
//! It is worth nothing at all when the nursery is *fully live*. `retain.ts`
//! (3M records, none ever dropped) measured **1.000** young-survival on every
//! copying minor, so every one of its 2.1M promotions paid ~240 ns of
//! bookkeeping to move an object that had no reason to move.
//!
//! Whole-block promotion is the standard answer (V8 calls it page promotion):
//! when a block is (near-)entirely live, relabel the block as old-gen instead
//! of evacuating it object by object. Nothing moves, so there is no copy, no
//! allocation, no layout transfer, no move hook, no forwarding pointer, and —
//! because addresses are unchanged — **no slot anywhere in the heap or in any
//! address-keyed runtime side table needs rewriting**.
//!
//! # Shape of the operation
//!
//! Promotion is decided *per cycle*, not per block, because a block's liveness
//! is not knowable before the trace and block identity does not survive a reset
//! (Eden blocks are recycled at offset 0). What IS knowable is the previous
//! cycle's measured young-survival ratio, and that ratio is re-measured on
//! every cycle including the promoting ones — see `gc::promote_in_place`. So a
//! misprediction costs at most one nursery's worth of retained garbage before
//! the policy corrects itself.
//!
//! The two halves:
//!
//! * [`retag_young_for_in_place_promotion`] runs *before* the trace. It flips
//!   every in-use Eden and survivor block's page range — BOTH semispaces, see
//!   the comment on the loop — to generation
//!   `Old`, space [`HeapSpace::PromotedYoung`]. From that instant the barrier
//!   predicates (`barrier_parent_needs_remembering`,
//!   `remembered_child_needs_tracking`) treat those objects as old — which is
//!   what makes the trace record the right remembered-set edges — while
//!   `classify_arena` can still tell they were young at cycle start and so must
//!   be traced once. The blocks stay in their own arenas for the duration, so
//!   no old-gen allocation can land in them mid-cycle.
//! * [`finish_in_place_promotion`] runs where the from-space reset would have.
//!   It walks each block linearly (cheap: one `size` hop per object, no
//!   hashing), stamps `GC_FLAG_TENURED` on every header so the `Old ⟹ TENURED`
//!   invariant the generated write barrier's fast path relies on (#7511) still
//!   holds, registers the **marked** (live) objects into the old-gen page index
//!   in per-page bulk runs, moves the block into `OLD_ARENA` leaving a
//!   tombstone behind, and retags the range to plain [`HeapSpace::Old`].
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT done
//!
//! Unmarked objects on a promoted block are dead. They are neither swept nor
//! registered — they stay as old-gen garbage until the next full mark-sweep,
//! which finds them through the ordinary linear old-arena walk. That retention
//! is the entire footprint cost of the technique, it is bounded by
//! `(1 − liveness) × young bytes` per cycle, and the policy layer both caps its
//! running total and reports it in the GC trace.
