///
/// Picked 1 MB: RSS essentially tied with 512 KB, block-count overhead
/// 2× smaller, `bench_gc_pressure` / `object_create` unchanged.
///
/// Trade-offs:
/// - More blocks in the arena for the same total bytes → walker loops
///   pay more per-block overhead. Measured: negligible — the walker is
///   O(objects), not O(blocks), once inside a block.
/// - More frequent "block full, advance to next" transitions in the
///   inline bump allocator's slow path. The slow path is a function
///   call; on `object_create` the cost is amortized across hundreds of
///   thousands of allocs per block before GC resets it. Measured:
///   `07_object_create` 0-1 ms unchanged.
/// - Large single allocations (Buffer.alloc(3 MB), big arena strings)
///   get a custom-sized block via `alloc_block(min_size)` that rounds
///   up to a BLOCK_SIZE multiple — unchanged mechanics, just rounds to
///   1 MB granularity now.
/// - The GC's adaptive step (gc.rs `GC_THRESHOLD_INITIAL_BYTES = 128
///   MB`) is unchanged; the workload still needs 128 MB of total arena
///   to trigger the first GC. With 1 MB blocks that's 128 blocks, and
///   `bench_json_roundtrip` hits that point at roughly the same

// Block dealloc/realloc round-trips through the process allocator were the
// dominant term of tree.ts's scavenge-on peak RSS: every promoted-then-dropped
// cohort released its old-gen blocks and the next cohort's promotions landed
// in FRESH allocator segments, so the union of ever-dirtied pages grew with
// cumulative promotion volume (~230 MB resident for a ~35 MB live set) while
// a cap matrix showed the young-cap dial barely moves RSS at all (64/32/16 MB
// caps → 235/221/226 MB). Recycling released blocks bounds ever-dirtied pages
// at the CONCURRENT high-water instead.
//
// Pooled blocks are `MADV_FREE`d so the OS can take the pages under memory
// pressure; contents are undefined on reuse, which every consumer tolerates
// (blocks are bump-filled from offset 0 and re-registered by the arena that
// adopts them). The pool is capped; overflow falls through to real dealloc,
// and thread teardown (`Arena::drop`) never pools.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Owns the pooled blocks, so that a thread exiting with a non-empty pool
/// releases them instead of leaking up to the process-wide pool cap.
///
/// The ownership has to live *here* rather than in a drain called from
/// `Arena::drop`: both are TLS destructors, their relative order is not
/// specified, and `LocalKey::with` panics once its own destructor has run —
/// so a drain could be skipped exactly when it is needed. A `Drop` on the
/// pool's own value is order-independent by construction.
///
/// Matters for `perry/thread`: `spawn`/`parallelMap` give every agent its own
/// arena and GC, so each exiting agent thread would otherwise strand its
/// pooled blocks — unbounded growth across repeated spawns, in the one change
/// whose purpose is lowering RSS.

//
//     HotKey::get -> hot() -> hot_uncached -> hot_via_tls
//       -> (temp_roots still null) fill()
//         -> arena_hot_addr() -> ARENA.with(..) -> Arena::new

//             -> HotKey::get -> hot() -> ... (temp_roots STILL null) ...
//
// `fill` writes `temp_roots` last precisely so a re-entrant reader cannot see a
// half-filled cache as ready — which makes the nesting re-run `fill`, and
// re-run `ARENA`'s initializer, without bound. It bites on any thread where
// the first `hot()` precedes the first arena touch, i.e. every freshly spawned
// one, and it fails as a crash rather than as a slow path.
//
// The rule this is an instance of: a declaration read from the dynamic extent
// of a `tls_hot::fill` provider cannot use `crate::perry_thread_local!`. Today
// `ARENA` is the only provider whose initializer runs code, so this is the
// whole set.
