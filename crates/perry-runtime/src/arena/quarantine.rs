//! From-space quarantine, poison and page protection (#7154 tooling).
//!
//! # What this exists to fix
//!
//! After an evacuating minor, `copying_reset_from_spaces_and_flip` sets every
//! Eden / active-survivor block's `offset` back to 0 and the bump allocator
//! starts handing the same bytes out again on the very next allocation. A
//! mutator register that still holds a *from-space* address — the #7154 family
//! of codegen rooting bugs — therefore does not fault. It reads a perfectly
//! valid, freshly-constructed, completely unrelated object. The program keeps
//! running and dies one or more cycles later, in a different function, as
//! `TypeError: value is not a function`.
//!
//! Detection latency is the whole problem: the fault is separated from its
//! cause by an arbitrary amount of execution.
//!
//! This module removes the recycling. Under `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE` the
//! evacuated from-space blocks are not reset — they are **detached from the
//! arena** into a bounded quarantine ring, poisoned, and (in the default mode)
//! `mprotect(PROT_NONE)`d. A stale dereference then faults **at the faulting
//! instruction**, with the holder still on the stack, and the installed
//! SIGSEGV/SIGBUS reporter names the address, the minor that retired it, and
//! the last-known object that lived there.
//!
//! # What the knob actually gates (read this before trusting a run)
//!
//! `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE` gates **only** the from-space reset performed
//! by the **copying (evacuating) minor** — `copying_reset_from_spaces_and_flip`
//! and nothing else. It does *not*:
//!
//! - touch the non-moving minor's in-place sweep (`arena_reset_empty_blocks`),
//! - touch the full mark-sweep's block reclaim,
//! - touch old-gen defrag or the malloc registry sweep,
//! - make a collection happen that would not otherwise have happened.
//!
//! So a run with this knob on and **zero copying minors** protects nothing and
//! proves nothing. `quarantine_stats()` reports `sets_retired` precisely so a
//! green result can be checked against its subject having been live (CLAUDE.md,
//! "four ways a gate can be unable to fail", #4). Pair it with
//! `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED=<u64> PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE=1` to guarantee
//! evacuating minors actually run at every handled safepoint.
//!
//! # Modes
//!
//! | value | effect |
//! |---|---|
//! | unset / `0` / `off` / `false` | inert — the normal reset path runs, byte-for-byte |
//! | `1` / `on` / `true` | poison **and** `mprotect(PROT_NONE)` the page-aligned interior |
//! | `poison` | poison only, no `mprotect` (for hosts/tests where faulting is not wanted) |
//!
//! `mprotect` needs page granularity and arena blocks are `alloc`'d at 16-byte
//! alignment, so the *page-aligned interior* of each block is protected and the
//! (at most two) sub-page edge fragments are poison-filled instead. Both are
//! counted separately — a protected-byte total that silently collapsed to zero
//! would read exactly like a clean run.
//!
//! # Platform support
//!
//! Page protection and the fault reporter are **Unix-only**: they are built on
//! `mprotect` / `sigaction` / `sysconf`, none of which the `libc` crate exposes
//! on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` — a target `perry-runtime` really is compiled
//! for (`test.yml`'s `windows-build` job, and `release-packages.yml` via
//! `perry-ui-windows` → `perry-runtime`). On non-Unix targets `ProtectPages`
//! degrades to poison-only rather than failing to build. That degradation is
//! *observable, not silent*: `mprotect_range` reports failure, so `protected`
//! stays `None` and `bytes_protected` stays 0 while `bytes_poisoned` counts the
//! whole retired range — which is exactly what the separate counters exist to
//! reveal.
//!
//! # Memory bound
//!
//! `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH` (default 4) caps how many retired
//! page-sets stay quarantined. Evicting a set restores `PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE`
//! and hands the blocks **back to Eden** rather than freeing them, so the
//! quarantine is a ring buffer: steady-state footprint is bounded by
//! `depth × from-space bytes` and no `mprotect`ed page is ever handed to
//! `dealloc`.
//!
//! **Depth is the knob to raise when a suspected bug does not fault.** A stale
//! pointer is only caught while the page-set it names is still quarantined, and
//! at `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE=1` a value can cross *hundreds* of collections between
//! its last valid observation and its stale use — one per loop back-edge poll.
//! Measured on #7154's `new C(…)` reproducer: the constructor body runs 600
//! polls, so the caller's stale register is 600 retirements old by the time
//! `js_ctor_return_override` publishes it, and the default depth of 4 misses it
//! silently. `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH=800` faults on the first use.
//! Rule of thumb: depth ≥ the number of safepoints the suspect value survives.
//!
//! Two consequences worth knowing before reading numbers off a protected run,
//! both direct and both only under the knob:
//!
//! - Quarantined bytes are subtracted from `ARENA_TOTAL_BYTES` when the block
//!   leaves the arena, so `arena_total_bytes()` — and therefore the arena-bytes
//!   GC trigger — under-reports real RSS by up to `depth × from-space bytes`.
//!   Fewer automatic triggers, not more. Pair with a seeded schedule if the
//!   point of the run is collection frequency.
//! - RSS is genuinely higher than an unprotected run for the same reason. This
//!   is a debug instrument; do not benchmark under it.
