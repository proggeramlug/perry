//! Every function object carries a real ShapeId (the every-receiver-shape
//! lane, stage 1).
//!
//! A closure's word at payload +4 — the same word an `ObjectHeader` keeps its
//! ShapeId in — names:
//!
//! * [`ShapeObjectKind::Function`] with the prototype its body kind implies
//!   (`Function.prototype`, `%AsyncFunction.prototype%`,
//!   `%GeneratorFunction.prototype%`, `%AsyncGeneratorFunction.prototype%`),
//!   while the closure's own properties are exactly the intrinsic ones
//!   (`name`, `length`, `prototype`) and nothing recorded a [[Prototype]];
//! * [`ShapeObjectKind::FunctionDictionary`] once anything else was installed:
//!   the answer then lives on the object (its side tables), exactly as a
//!   dictionary-mode `ObjectHeader`'s does.
//!
//! Both are minted in the exotic band (`shapes::EXOTIC_SHAPE_ID_BASE`), which
//! no own-inline-slot site word accepts, so no emitted cache can ever load
//! `closure + 16 + 8*slot` as if it were an object slot.
//!
//! The transition is one-way and happens at the funnels that change what a
//! closure answers: an own-property install (`closure_set_dynamic_prop`), a
//! delete, an accessor/descriptor install, a recorded [[Prototype]]. The kind
//! of a cell is its GC type byte — never a magic word in its payload.
