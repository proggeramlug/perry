//! Canonical `{ value, done }` iterator-result construction (#7564).
//!
//! Every `.next()` that the runtime answers itself — array, string, typed
//! array/Buffer, Map/Set, and the `Iterator.from(...)` helper chain — hands
//! back a two-field object. Five copies of the constructor had drifted apart,
//! and all five allocated **five** heap objects to deliver one value:
//!
//! | allocation | information it carries |
//! |---|---|
//! | the result object | the value and the done flag |
//! | `"value"` string | none — same six bytes every call |
//! | `"done"` string | none — same four bytes every call |
//! | the 2-element keys array | none — same two pointers every call |
//! | the shape install keyed on that array's ADDRESS | none, and worse: a *new* shape id per call |
//!
//! Four of the five are the same constant on every call, so this module
//! builds them once per thread and shares them. That is sound because
//! `keys_array` sharing is already how object literals and `JSON.parse`
//! results work: the array is stamped [`GC_FLAG_SHAPE_SHARED`], and every
//! path that would mutate an object's key list — adding a property
//! (`field_set_by_name`), deleting one (`delete_rest`), or a proxy trap
//! (`proxy::put_value`) — clones before writing. Nothing can reach through
//! a result object and disturb the shared array.
//!
//! The shape install is the reason this is more than an allocation win.
//! `shape_id_for_keys_ensure` keys the shape table on the keys array's
//! ADDRESS, so a fresh array per `.next()` minted a fresh shape id per
//! `.next()` — every read of `.value`/`.done` off the result was a
//! guaranteed inline-cache miss, and the shape table grew without bound.
//! One shared array means one shape id for every iterator result in the
//! program.
//!
//! ## Rooting
//!
//! The old constructors were also a live stale-from-space defect. They ran
//! five allocations back to back with every intermediate in a bare Rust
//! local: a copying minor inside allocation *k* moved what locals 1..k-1
//! named and rewrote only slots it could see, which a Rust local is not.
//! `array/iter_object.rs`'s copy was rooted by #7475; the other four were
//! not, and `collection_iter_object.rs`'s was observed taking a bus error on
//! a retired from-space key string under `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE=1`.
//!
//! This module removes the hazard structurally rather than by adding roots
//! to a five-allocation sequence: on the steady-state path there is exactly
//! **one** allocation (the result object), and both pointers used after it
//! are re-read from storage the collector rewrites — the object from its
//! [`RuntimeHandleScope`] handle, the keys array from the thread-local
//! `ITER_RESULT_KEYS` slot that [`scan_iter_result_keys_roots_mut`] visits.
//! No pre-collection address is nameable.
//!
//! `ITER_RESULT_KEYS` is exactly the "runtime-side cache of a raw heap
//! pointer" that the static `gc_root_dominance_check.py` cannot see, so its
//! scanner is registered in `gc/mod.rs` in the same commit — see the
//! "unrooted runtime caches" note in CLAUDE.md.
