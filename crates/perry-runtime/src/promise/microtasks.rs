    // an async benchmark with 200k microtasks pays ~5 ms in setjmp cost
    // alone. The single outer setjmp captures the same "throw out of a
    // microtask body" case (since `js_throw` longjmps to the most recent
    // try block; if no user try is in scope, this one is it). When the
    // longjmp lands, we read the current promise context out of a

    // ── macOS/BSD: the arm uses `_setjmp` (no signal-mask save) ────

    // `sigprocmask` system call AND saves the alt-signal-stack via
    // `__sigaltstack` — measured at ~43% of `promise_all_chains` CPU.
    // Perry never `siglongjmp`s out of a signal handler, so the fast
    // `_setjmp(3)` is used instead. That per-platform choice now lives in
    // the C trampoline (`src/ffi/perry_sjlj.c`); on glibc Linux the plain
    // `setjmp(3)` already skips the signal-mask save.

    // the normal path, and the longjmp return path reloaded NULL. One
    // `js_try_push` for the whole drain, one re-arm per caught throw; the
