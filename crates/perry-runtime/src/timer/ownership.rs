//! Agent-ownership bookkeeping for the timer queues (#6185 Tier 2).
//!
//! The queues in `timer.rs` are process-global, but every pointer they hold —
//! promise, callback closure, NaN-boxed arg — belongs to the arena of the agent
//! that scheduled the timer. `timer.rs` enforces that at every read (tick,
//! next-deadline, liveness, active-handle count) and `gc_scan.rs` enforces it in
//! the collector. This module owns the two pieces that are purely about
//! ownership: per-agent event-loop liveness, and what happens to an agent's
//! timers when the agent itself goes away.
