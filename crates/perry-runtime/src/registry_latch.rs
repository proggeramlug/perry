//! Monotone "has this feature ever been used?" latches for side-table probes.
//!
//! The runtime answers "is this value special?" for a large number of exotic
//! kinds — typed array, `Buffer`, `SharedArrayBuffer` backing, `Symbol`,
//! `DataView`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Map`, `Set` — by consulting an address-keyed
//! side table. Those probes sit on *generic* paths (property get/set, element
//! access, `typeof`, coercion, `JSON.stringify`, console formatting, GC header
//! reads), so a program pays for every kind it does not use, on every value it
//! touches. Each probe costs at minimum a thread-local resolution (on Darwin
//! that is a real call through `_tlv_get_addr` — there is no local-exec TLS)
//! plus a `RefCell` borrow and a hash, and for the process-global tables a
//! mutex acquisition.
//!
//! Symbolicated profiles of two unrelated realistic programs measured **13% of
//! total runtime** in exactly these probes, for features neither program used:
//! an async service pipeline spent 2.45% in `lookup_typed_array_kind`, 2.40% in
//! `is_registered_buffer`, 1.22% in `is_shared_sab` and 0.71% in
//! `is_registered_symbol` while allocating no typed array, no `Buffer`, no
//! `SharedArrayBuffer` and no `Symbol`; a tree-walking interpreter showed the
//! same two leaders independently.
//!
//! [`RegistryLatch`] removes that tax. It is a process-global `AtomicBool` that
//! starts `false` and is armed by the *registration* site. A probe checks it
//! first and answers "no" from a single atomic load when the feature has never
//! been used. #7474 established the pattern for `map`/`set`; this type
//! generalises it so the remaining probes get it without copy-paste.
//!
//! # Why monotone
//!
//! The latch has no `disarm`, deliberately — there is no counter to get wrong
//! and no ordering hazard between an unregister and a concurrent probe. Once
//! armed the process pays the ordinary slow path forever, which is merely
//! slower, never wrong. That asymmetry is the whole safety argument: the only
//! *incorrect* observation this design can produce is `idle` while a table is
//! non-empty. `armed` while every table is empty is free of consequence.
//!
//! # The ordering rule (binding)
//!
//! **`arm()` must be called BEFORE the registry mutation it advertises, in the
//! registering thread's program order.** Arming *after* the insert opens a
//! window in which the feature is live and reachable but the latch still reads
//! idle, so a concurrent probe takes the fast path and answers `false` for an
//! address that is genuinely registered. That is not hypothetical: the sibling
//! latch `buffer::header::EXTERNAL_BUFFERS_NONEMPTY` carries an inline comment
//! for precisely this reason, and `js_buffer_register_external` latches first.
//!
//! With the arm placed first, the argument for a reader on *another* thread is:
//! a thread can only probe an address it holds, and every route by which an
//! address reaches a different thread in this runtime passes through a
//! synchronising edge (the `SerializedValue` deep-copy queue and the
//! `PENDING_THREAD_RESULTS` drain are both mutex/channel mediated). The arm
//! precedes the registration, which precedes the hand-off, so the arm is in the
//! reader's happens-before past and the reader must observe it. The
//! thread-local tables (`BUFFER_REGISTRY`, `TYPED_ARRAY_REGISTRY`,
//! `UINT8ARRAY_FROM_CTOR`) need even less: only the arming thread can find
//! their entries at all, and a thread always observes its own prior store.
//!
//! `Acquire`/`Release` is therefore stronger than today's routes require —
//! `Relaxed` would be sound given the hand-off edges above. It costs one
//! instruction and removes the need to re-audit this file the next time someone
//! publishes a heap address through a lock-free path, so the stronger ordering
//! is what ships.

///
/// | probe | calls | a window rejects | this filter rejects |
/// |---|---|---|---|
/// | `is_registered_symbol` | 378,163 | 38.3% | **99.58%** |
/// | `is_registered_class_prototype_object` | 26,290 | 54.0% | **99.05%** |
///
/// (`is_uint8array_buffer`, whose entries are `BufferHeader`s, is the opposite
/// case: a window rejects **100%** of its 540,328 calls, so it keeps the
/// cheaper shape. Both are in the tree on purpose; pick by measurement.)
///
/// # The contract, which is the window's contract
///
/// `may_contain` returning `false` means "definitively not registered". A Bloom
/// filter has false positives and no false negatives, which is exactly the
/// asymmetry the probes need: a false positive costs the ordinary lookup that
/// was already there, and a false negative — the one dangerous answer — cannot
/// occur while every registration sets its bits before it publishes.
///
/// Bits are only ever SET, never cleared, so unregistration (death pruning, the
/// GC's dead-buffer sweep) leaves the filter a weaker approximation, never a
/// wrong one. There is deliberately no `clear`.
///
/// # Sizing
///
/// 1,024 bits (16 `AtomicU64`, two cache lines) and three probes per address.
/// `claude-code --help` registers **100** symbols and **160** class prototypes,
/// so at 160 entries the theoretical false-positive rate is
/// `(1 - e^(-3·160/1024))³ ≈ 1.6%`; the measured rates on the real address
/// streams were 0.26% and 0.49%.
///
/// **The saturation regime is deliberate, and it is the reason `WORDS` is the
/// only knob.** `CLASS_PROTOTYPE_OBJECTS` grows by one entry per ES5-transpiled
/// constructor (#9225), so a bundle much larger than claude-code's can push it
/// past ~700 entries, where 1,024 bits saturate and `may_contain` starts
/// answering `true` for almost everything. That is not a correctness cliff and
/// not a regression: a saturated filter is exactly the code that ran before it
/// existed — the probe falls through to the lookup it always did. It is a
/// *win* cliff. If a corpus is found sitting on the wrong side of it, raise
/// `WORDS`: 64 words (4,096 bits, 512 B) holds ~640 entries at the same
/// false-positive rate and is still trivially L1-resident. The value shipped
/// here is the one the measurements above were taken at, and is deliberately
/// not raised on speculation.
///
/// **Bits accrue per ADMISSION, not per live entry.** Both tables this guards
/// are re-keyed by the collector — a symbol or a prototype that is evacuated is
/// admitted again at its new address, and the bits its old address set are
/// never cleared — so a long-running program with a moving nursery walks
/// towards saturation over time rather than sitting at a fixed occupancy. That
/// is measurable rather than theoretical, and it was measured: re-running the
/// answer census on the shipped `claude --help` binary, the symbol filter ended
/// the run admitting 1,492 of 378,163 probes, of which 622 were genuine — 870
/// false positives, a 0.23% rate against a population that had been evacuated
/// and re-admitted throughout. The bound to watch is the false-positive rate at
/// END of run, not the registration count.
///
/// # The ordering rule (binding, and identical to [`RegistryAddrWindow`]'s)
///
/// **[`admit`](Self::admit) must run BEFORE the registry mutation it
/// advertises.** Setting the bits after the insert opens a window in which an
/// address is registered but the filter denies it.
///
/// The three words are separate atomics, so a racing reader can observe a mix
/// of old and new. That is harmless for the same reason it is harmless for the
/// window: each word only ever gains bits, so once `may_contain` holds for an
/// address it holds forever, and a partially-observed filter is only ever a
/// weaker filter — never one that rejects something it used to accept.
///
/// Cross-thread visibility rests on `admit`'s `AcqRel` read-modify-writes, and
