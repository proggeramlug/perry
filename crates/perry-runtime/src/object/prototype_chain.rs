//! Observable `[[Prototype]]` for ordinary heap objects (#2820, #6759 B).
//!
//! Perry bakes class IDs at allocation time, so it cannot rewrite an object's
//! baked prototype chain. But `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto)` on an
//! *ordinary* object (a `{}` literal, an `Object.create(...)` result, etc.)
//! must be observable: a later `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` returns the same
//! `proto`, and an inherited property read (`obj.x` where `x` lives on `proto`)
//! walks to it.
//!
//! Storage is split by owner kind (#6759 Phase B):
//!
//! * A genuine shaped `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` stores the recorded bits in its own
//!   per-object [`crate::object::ObjectMeta`] record, reached from the
//!   object header in two dependent loads — no mutex, no address-keyed
//!   probe, and structurally immune to the stale-address-reuse hazard (the
//!   record lives and dies with its owner; GC traces/rewrites it through
//!   the ordinary Object descriptor).
//! * Every other owner kind — real/lazy arrays, typed arrays, native
//!   handle-band ids, proxy ids — keeps the RESIDUAL address-keyed registry
//!   below, with its original GC hooks (scanner, owner-move rekey,
//!   dead-owner prune). Migrating arrays needs an `ArrayHeader` slot and is
//!   a later #6759 tranche.
//!
//! `proto_bits` for an explicit `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, null)` is
//! `TAG_NULL`, so a recorded-null entry is distinguishable from "no entry
//! recorded" (default prototype); in the meta record, 0 means unset.
