//! #10905: in-object slack tracking, owned by the BIRTH shape.
//!
//! An object born with no keys (`Object.create(P)`) used to get the
//! allocator's two-slot floor whatever its program went on to store, so its
//! third own key and every later one lived in overflow storage for the
//! object's whole life (overflow is permanent: nothing moves a spilled value
//! back inline). A spilled store measured ~220 instructions over an inline
//! one and a spilled read ~100.
//!
//! The fix is V8's in-object slack tracking, expressed as a fact of the
//! shape. `Object.create(P)` is born on the keyless shape `(P, [])` — the
//! BIRTH shape of every object created from P, one per prototype because the
//! prototype is part of shape identity (#11342). That record, and nothing
//! else, carries two numbers in bits its word already reserved:
//!
//! * the WIDTH its descendants grow to: the largest key count of any shape
//!   minted with prototype P (every shape of the transition tree below the
//!   birth shape is minted exactly once, so this is the tree's maximum, which
//!   is what V8 computes when tracking completes), raised further by any
//!   descendant that spills past its inline slots;
//! * a count of the births served while tracking.
//!
//! The first [`TRACKING_BIRTHS`] births are allocated [`TRACKING_WIDTH`] slots
//! wide (or wider, if the width learned so far is larger), so the objects a
//! program creates first — often the only ones — keep their fields inline.
//! Every later birth is allocated at exactly the learned width, and at the
//! allocator's floor when nothing grew. The width is capacity only: the keys
//! stay authoritative, and a birth at width `w` is stamped with the shape
//! `(P, [], live w)`, the same "(keys, width) birth ShapeId" a class born
//! wide gets (`js_object_shape_id_for_class_keys_live`, #11360).
//!
//! Objects already allocated keep working: a key past their inline slots
//! spills exactly as before, and that spill is what teaches the record.
//! Nothing here is consulted by a read or a write; only the allocation of a
//! keyless birth asks, and only the mint and spill paths teach.
//!
//! Polymorphic growth takes the MAXIMUM: descendants of one birth shape that
//! grow to different widths are all born at the widest, capped at
//! [`LEARNED_WIDTH_MAX`] slots. That is the memory cost, and it is bounded:
//! an object smaller than the maximum carries at most the difference in
//! unused inline slots, against the 16-slot overflow array (plus header) the
//! narrow birth allocates on its first spill.
//!
//! Lifetime: the facts live exactly as long as the record. The record is
//! kept through a full collection when a birth asked it during the epoch
//! before ([`RECORD_FLAG_BIRTH_OWNER`], cleared by the epoch rotation), and
//! pruned like any uncarried shape otherwise — a prototype nobody creates
//! from any more forgets its width and relearns it on its next births.
