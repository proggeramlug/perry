/// `(class_id, method_name)` the tower has already resolved to a vtable method.
///
/// `js_native_call_method` is the virtual-call path for every receiver whose
/// static type does not pin the callee — which is *every* call through a
/// base-typed collection, the shape a class hierarchy is written in. Reaching
/// its vtable arm costs a `String` allocation for the method name, a
/// `RuntimeHandleScope`, ~900 lines of probes for exotic receiver kinds, a
/// GC-heap `StringHeader` allocation for the prototype-chain probe, a
/// process-global `RwLock` read and two SipHash lookups. For `shape.area()`
/// that is four heap allocations and a lock around a single multiply.
///
/// # Why a cache hit is sound
///
/// An [`obj_dispatch_ic`](crate::object::class_registry::obj_dispatch_ic_lookup)
/// entry exists ONLY because an earlier call with this exact
/// `(class_id, method_name_ptr)` ran the entire tower and fell through to the
/// vtable arm. That is the proof that no *name-keyed* or *class-keyed* probe in
/// the tower claims this pair.
///
/// Everything the tower decides per RECEIVER rather than per (class, name) is
/// re-established here, on every hit:
///
/// * the value is a NaN-boxed pointer to a real heap object above the handle
///   band (excludes every small-handle registry receiver, and every primitive);
/// * its GC type is `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` and its GcHeader carries no class-object
///   marker (excludes errors, arrays, maps, buffers, regexes, closures, and
///   class values — each of which the tower routes elsewhere);
/// * `class_id` matches the cache key;
/// * `meta` is null, so the object carries no `Object.setPrototypeOf` override,
///   no per-key descriptor state, and no exotic-kind tag — this is *stricter*
///   than the tower, which tolerates a meta record and resolves through it;
/// * no OWN key equals the method name, using the same byte comparison the
///   tower's field scan uses (an own field shadows the vtable);
/// * no static prototype is recorded for the address, so the tower's
///   `resolve_inherited_field` probe would have found nothing to shadow with.
///
/// A miss (`None`) is always safe: the caller falls through to the full tower.
/// The receiver-shape predicate `G` shared by the fast path and by the sites
/// that are allowed to populate its cache.
///
/// Returns the receiver's `class_id` when `object` is an ORDINARY heap
/// instance of a user class: everything the dispatch tower decides per RECEIVER
/// rather than per (class, name) is pinned here, so two receivers that both
/// satisfy `G` with the same class id and method name provably reach the same
/// resolution.
///
/// * NaN-boxed pointer above the handle band — excludes every small-handle
///   registry receiver (timers, sockets, zlib streams, TextDecoder, …) and
///   every primitive;
/// * `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` without the class-object marker — excludes arrays,
///   strings, errors, maps, sets, regexes, closures, and class values, each of
///   which the tower routes to its own dispatcher;
/// * not a registered `Buffer` and not a typed array — the two address-keyed
///   probes the tower runs ahead of the class walk that a `GC_TYPE_OBJECT`
///   receiver could in principle also answer. Both are latched (#7755), so in
///   a program using neither this is two atomic loads;
/// * `meta` null — no `Object.setPrototypeOf` override, no per-key descriptor
///   state, no exotic-kind tag. STRICTER than the tower, which resolves
///   through a meta record;
/// * no OWN key equal to the method name (an own field shadows the vtable),
///   using the tower's own byte comparison;
/// * no recorded static prototype for the address, so the tower's
///   `resolve_inherited_field` probe had nothing to shadow with.

    // primitives via Number/Boolean/BigInt prototypes; when the
    // prototype lookup yields undefined, the call site throws.
    // Without primitive auto-boxing, Perry must surface the same
    // diagnostic at dispatch time — silently returning the
    // null-object sentinel (the historical fall-through below) lets
    // typo'd method calls run as no-ops, masking real bugs.
    //
    // Strings don't reach this catch-all in the typical case —
    // codegen's `lower_string_method` intercepts string-typed
    // receivers and throws there directly (matching ABI). The string
    // arm is left in here for the rare path where a string flows
    // through dynamic dispatch (e.g. raw NaN-boxed receiver from a
    // Map.get() result the user typed as `any`).
    //
    // Real-object receivers keep the `NULL_OBJECT_BYTES`
    // fall-through. Many existing call paths use this dispatcher as
    // a generic shortcut and rely on the silent null-object return
    // for unknown methods; tightening that is tracked separately.
    //
    // Issue #511: `undefined` / `null` receivers must throw a node-shaped
    // `TypeError: Cannot read properties of <kind> (reading '<method>')`
    // and exit 1. Codegen's `Expr::PropertyGet` lowering already throws
    // on the bare property read (`obj.foo`, issue #462), but the
    // `Call { callee: PropertyGet }` shortcut in `lower_call.rs`
    // routes `obj.foo()` straight to `js_native_call_method` without
    // re-evaluating the receiver through PropertyGet — so the codegen
    // gate never fires for the call form. Without this arm, `x.foo()`
    // on `undefined` silently returned `NULL_OBJECT_BYTES` and the
    // process exited 0, breaking CI gates that rely on non-zero exit
    // for uncaught errors. Earlier toString/bind/push/pop/length match
    // arms intentionally short-circuit before this point so existing
    // Perry code that calls those on `undefined`/`null` keeps working
