//! Per-(class_id, interned-key) property STORE-PLAN cache.
//!
//! `js_object_set_field_by_name` pays a long interception vet on every store
//! to a class instance (`class_id != 0`): the `CLASS_VTABLE_REGISTRY` RwLock +
//! per-level string-hash setter walk, then
//! `plain_data_write_may_intercept` → `class_instance_set_may_intercept`,
//! which allocates a Rust `String` for the key and probes the address-keyed
//! descriptor tables (each probe re-allocating a `(usize, String)` map key)
//! for every prototype level. Profiled on a fiber-shaped workload this vet is
//! the dominant per-store cost — and its verdict is a pure function of
//! (class chain, key) plus per-object bits the caller checks separately.
//!
//! This cache memoizes the FAST verdict only: "a store of `key` to an
//! instance of `class_id` whose per-object flags are clear cannot be
//! intercepted" — no vtable setter in the chain, no class-prototype
//! accessor/non-writable descriptor, no `Object.prototype` own-key trap.
//! Misses simply take today's slow path; a recorded verdict lets the next
//! store of the same (class, key) skip straight to the shape-transition
//! cache.
//!
//! ## Invalidation
//! A verdict goes stale only when one of its inputs changes:
//!   * vtable mutation (setter/getter/method registration, parent linking) —
//!     tracked by the existing [`VTABLE_GEN`] generation counter, captured in
//!     the entry and compared on lookup;
//!   * descriptor installs/clears anywhere (a class prototype object may be
//!     the target), `setPrototypeOf` recording, `Object.prototype` index
//!     notes — these call [`prop_plan_epoch_bump`];
//!   * GC — interned key pointers can move or die across a collection, so
//!     the epoch is also bumped from the intern-table root scan and the
//!     dead-owner prune fan-out (both run in every collection flavor).
//!     Between collections an interned string cannot be freed or relocated,
//!     so pointer identity holds for the lifetime of an epoch window.
//!
//! Per-OBJECT conditions (frozen/sealed/no-extend, own descriptors,
//! per-instance `setPrototypeOf` override, null-proto) are NOT part of the
//! verdict — the caller checks header flags plus the ObjectMeta prototype-
//! override bit before honoring a hit.
