//! #10507: `new F()` and `x instanceof F` for an ordinary compiled function.
//!
//! A function object whose body the compiler emitted (`FN_COMPILED_BODY`)
//! and that is not an arrow, async, generator or class body is an ordinary
//! function: its `[[Construct]]` is OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor plus the
//! body, and its `@@hasInstance` is Function.prototype's (an own one needs a
//! symbol key, which moves the function object to FunctionDictionary). That
//! is a fact of the body, read from the function object's info, so these
//! paths skip every built-in, bound, proxy and native-module probe.
//!
//! The object a construction creates is described by `F.prototype`: its
//! class id and birth ShapeId are the prototype object's birth record
//! (`ObjectMeta::instance_birth`), minted on the first construction by the
//! ordinary allocate-then-link sequence and replayed afterwards — the same
//! class id and the same ShapeId (its `proto_id` is the prototype's serial,
//! its record's `prototype` word the prototype itself) that sequence
//! produces, with no hash lookup and no per-instance record. A reassigned
//! `F.prototype` is read on the next construction; objects already created
//! keep the prototype their shapes name.
