//! The live inline-slot bound and the `ObjectHeader` ABI revision.
//!
//! `ObjectHeader` used to carry a `field_count: u32` word. It was derivable
//! from the object's immutable ShapeId descriptor, and removing it together
//! with the equally derivable `object_type` word took the header from 32 bytes
//! to 24 (a two-slot object from 56 to 48). #8047 removed the remaining
//! derived keys mirror, taking the header to 16 and the object to 40 bytes.

/// The bound used to be one `u32` load off the header and is now a shape-table
/// probe, so a 64-way direct-mapped `ShapeId -> count` cache looked like the
/// obvious recovery. It was built, sabotage-tested, and measured on the
/// 19-program corpus against the same baseline: `retain` +4.26% vs +3.26%
/// WITHOUT it, `retain_wide` +4.46% vs +2.89%, `retain_wide1` +4.18% vs +2.61%,
/// `deeplist` +8.69% vs +8.20% — worse on four of the five rows that pay the
/// bound at all, better only on `shapes`. The memo pays its own TLS resolution
/// and a closure, which is most of what `state()` + a small `HashMap<u32, _>`
/// probe costs. It was deleted rather than left in as an unmeasured
