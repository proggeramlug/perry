    // exactly one structural descriptor under that address — i.e. that
    // `retire_owned_shape_siblings` really is wired to the publish funnel and
    // growth history does not pile up under a reused address. It asserted its
    // own precondition, `first_addr_count > 0`, "some appends must grow the
    // owned array in place".
    //
    // WHY THE PREMISE IS NOW FALSE: canonical identity means one array per
    // ordered key list, so an append never keeps its address — the successor
    // is a different canonical array by construction. No keys array is owned
    // any more (every one is `GC_FLAG_SHAPE_SHARED` from birth), so there is
    // no in-place append for this test to observe, and `first_addr_count` is
    // 0 by construction rather than by regression. `retire_owned_shape_siblings`
    // is itself unreachable for the same reason.
    //
    // WHAT PINS THE REPLACEMENT PROPERTY: the concern was descriptors piling
    // up under one address. That is now impossible in a stronger form —
    // an address names exactly one key list, so a family under it can differ
    // only in the non-keys facts. `object::canonical_keys`'s
    // `one_array_serves_one_ordered_key_list` and `a_prefix_is_its_own_node`
    // pin the identity, and the mint census's `FUNNEL OK / FUNNEL BROKEN`
    // line pins it on a whole real program — it is the witness the funnel
    // sabotage reddens, where the parity suite structurally cannot.
