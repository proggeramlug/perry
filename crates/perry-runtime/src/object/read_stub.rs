//! Megamorphic stub cache for dynamic string-keyed property READS.
//!
//! The read twin of the dynamic-write stub in `proxy::put_value`, and it exists
//! for the same reason: a site that rotates more keys than a per-site cache can
//! hold gets no benefit from one, so the cache has to be keyed on the PROGRAM's
//! live `(shape, key)` pairs instead of on a site.
//!
//! What a hit skips is the point. `js_object_get_field_by_name`'s fast lane
//! re-proves a long chain on every read — address-class checks, the interned-key
//! flag, arena classification, header type/flags/class, keys-array validation —
//! and then consults the read-plan cache, whose epoch is bumped by the
//! incremental collector at loop-poll cadence, so on a plain read loop it is
//! repeatedly cold and falls through to a shape-index hash lookup. A stub hit
//! replaces all of that with a handful of loads and compares.
//!
//! # Why entries cannot go stale dangerously
//!
//! Every hit re-validates the receiver's CURRENT state: heap-object type, not
//! forwarded, none of the blocking flags, a real class id, and — decisively —
//! the receiver's current shape token. The token identifies the exact key set
//! AND order, so a matching token means the cached slot still names this key.
//! A stale entry therefore misses; it cannot resolve to the wrong property.
//!
//! Entries hold no roots and no addresses: the key is stored as CONTENT bits
//! (an SSO immediate, or a short ASCII heap string folded to the bits its
//! content would encode as), so a key that dies and has its address recycled
//! cannot produce a false hit. Keys that do not fit the inline form are simply
//! not cached — the same rule the write stub follows, and for the same reason.
//!
//! # Two ways, not one
//!
//! Direct-mapped was measured on the write side and it is a trap: a colliding
//! pair evicts each other on every rotation through the key set, so both miss
//! FOREVER — the miss is permanent, not probabilistic. Making that table 2-way
//! at equal capacity was worth 50% on the write loop (#8977). This one starts
//! 2-way for that reason.
