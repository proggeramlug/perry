//! #9675 regression coverage for [`canonicalize_bare_gc_receiver`].
//!
//! Two claims, and the second is the one that keeps a fix like this honest:
//!
//! * **the reclassification happens** — a bare `GC_TYPE_STRING` receiver comes
//!   back a STRING, a bare `GC_TYPE_BIGINT` receiver a BIGINT, an ordinary
//!   managed object a POINTER, an already-forwarded receiver at its CURRENT
//!   address, and a bare string receiver's dynamic `.slice` returns the sliced
//!   string instead of throwing;
//! * **nothing else is reclassified** — genuine subnormal doubles whose bits sit
//!   squarely in the heap-address range, unrelated allocations carrying
//!   synthetic GC headers, headerless registry handles, a fresh `Symbol()`
//!   (which is itself a `GC_TYPE_STRING` allocation), and every NaN-boxed value
//!   are returned bit-for-bit unchanged — and a word nothing vouched for is
//!   routed to NUMBER dispatch, so no magnitude-gated probe can dereference it.
//!
//! Without the second half this file would pass with the gate widened to "any
//! address-shaped word", which is exactly the mistake the magnitude-only tail
//! recovery makes.
