//! #9675: canonicalizing a LEGACY BARE managed receiver at the dispatch
//! tower's entry, before it is rooted and before the first probe.
//!
//! A "bare" receiver is a real GC pointer whose value was never NaN-boxed, so
//! its top 16 bits are zero and it decodes as a positive subnormal double.
//! Perry still produces this shape — `gc_pointer_and_type_from_value` accepts
//! it explicitly — and `js_native_call_method` recovered it, but only in the
//! last few lines of the tower and only ever as `POINTER_TAG`. Three separate
//! defects followed from that, and this module closes all three by rewriting
//! the receiver into the tag it actually deserves *at the entry*.
//!
//! ## 1. The receiver was rooted under a tag the collector ignores
//!
//! The tower roots its receiver with
//! [`RuntimeHandleScope::root_nanbox_f64`](crate::gc::RuntimeHandleScope::root_nanbox_f64),
//! which parks it in a `RuntimeHandleSlot::Nanbox`. That slot kind is marked by
//! `gc::try_mark_value` and rewritten by `gc::try_rewrite_nanboxed_value`, and
//! **both begin by rejecting any word whose tag is not
//! `POINTER_TAG`/`STRING_TAG`/`BIGINT_TAG`**. A bare pointer's tag is zero, so
//! rooting one as a nanbox
//!
//! * does not MARK the receiver — a full mark-sweep inside dispatch can reap
//!   it, and
//! * does not REWRITE the slot — an evacuating minor inside dispatch leaves it
//!   holding a from-space address.
//!
//! #7528 already established that the tower runs "~1160 more lines across a
//! dozen probes that allocate" after that root, and made every use re-read the
//! root slot rather than a local copy. That fix is necessary but not
//! sufficient: re-reading a slot the collector never rewrote returns the same
//! stale address. The tail recovery then validates it with magnitude-only
//! predicates (`is_above_handle_band` + `is_valid_obj_ptr`), which cannot tell
//! a live address from a stale one, and dispatches on whatever now occupies
//! those bytes.
//!
//! Canonicalizing here means the value the tower roots carries a tag the
//! collector traces AND rewrites, so the receiver is kept alive and every
//! `object()` re-read below yields its current address. This is the runtime-side
//! form of the root-dominance invariant in
//! `docs/src/internals/gc-rooting-invariant.md`: the static checker reads
//! emitted LLVM IR and cannot see a mis-tagged runtime root at all.
//!
//! ## 2. Strings and BigInts came back as objects
//!
//! `JSValue::pointer` stamps `POINTER_TAG` unconditionally. `is_any_string()`
//! accepts only `STRING_TAG`/`SHORT_STRING_TAG`, and `string_methods::
//! dispatch_string` gates on exactly that predicate — so a bare `GC_TYPE_STRING`
//! receiver was reboxed into something that is not a string, `.slice` never
//! reached the string arm, and the call fell through to the `<m> is not a
//! function` catch-all on a perfectly good string. `.slice` on a value that
//! must be a string is the reported symptom of #9675. BigInt had the same
//! shape via `BIGINT_TAG`.
//!
//! ## 3. An already-forwarded receiver was dispatched at its old address
//!
//! The tail recovery did no forwarding walk, so a bare receiver that a
//! collection had already moved was reboxed at its from-space address.
//!
//! ## What the gate is, and what it deliberately leaves alone
//!
//! Ownership, not address magnitude.
//! [`try_read_tracked_gc_header`](crate::value::addr_class::try_read_tracked_gc_header)
//! requires arena page membership or an exact malloc-registry hit, plus a valid
//! `obj_type`/`size`/arena-flag triple, before the first header byte is
//! touched. So this path does not reclassify
//!
//! * genuine subnormal numbers (including pointer-magnitude bit patterns),
//! * unrelated non-Perry allocations, even ones carrying synthetic GC headers,
//! * headerless registry handles and every other handle-band id, or
//! * any NaN-boxed value at all — one `bits >> 48` compare returns those
//!   untouched, so the ordinary receiver pays nothing.
//!
//! ## 4. An unvouched bare word was still read as a pointer, and faulted
//!
//! The mirror image of the above, and the reason this module owns the decision
//! rather than reboxing opportunistically. A genuine positive subnormal double
//! has bits that *look* like an address: `1e-310` is `0x1268_8b70_e62b`, which
//! is above the handle band and inside `is_valid_obj_ptr`'s platform window. The
//! tower's probes are magnitude-gated — `try_read_gc_header` classifies by
//! address range and then dereferences `addr - GC_HEADER_SIZE` — and that
//! contract is written for a STALE heap address, where the page is still
//! mapped. An arbitrary number is not a stale address; nothing was ever mapped
//! there. `(1e-310 as any).toString()` therefore SIGSEGV'd inside
//! `url::search_params::shape_is_url_search_params`, a probe that is itself
//! careful (it gates on `try_read_gc_header` precisely so a Date cell cannot
//! fault it) and simply cannot tell a number from an address. Node prints
//! `1e-310`. A smaller subnormal aliases the *handle* band instead — `5e-324`
//! is `0x1`, so the handle dispatcher answered it and
//! `(5e-324 as any).toString()` returned `undefined` where node returns
//! `"5e-324"`.
//!
//! Fixing the one probe that happened to fault would be whack-a-mole: every
//! magnitude-gated probe in the tower has the same exposure, and this codebase
//! has paid for that pattern three times over (CLAUDE.md, "Known-weak areas").
//! The chokepoint is here. Once an owner has been asked and declined, the word
//! is *definitively not a managed pointer*, so it is the number its bits spell
//! and [`dispatch_unvouched_bare_as_number`] dispatches it as one — it never
//! reaches a pointer-shaped probe at all. That makes the whole class
//! unreachable rather than fixing its current instance.
//!
//! Because of that, the tower's magnitude-only tail recovery is now
//! unreachable for bare words and is deleted with this change: it was the last
//! place that treated address magnitude as proof.

/// NaN-box, following forwarding. Returns `object` unchanged for everything
