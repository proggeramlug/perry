//! A runtime site's memo for one fixed own property name: on receivers whose
//! header word is `(class_id | ShapeId << 32)` = `word`, the name is an own
//! plain DATA property at key position `slot` (an inline slot, or for a site
//! that reads through the shape's live bound, a spill position).
//!
//! This is the runtime-side form of the method-site memo's own entry
//! (`method_site`), for runtime code that reads and writes a property by a
//! name fixed in its source (an emitter's `_events`, `_eventsCount`): the
//! entry is facts of ONE receiver word, compared on every use, and nothing is
//! keyed on a class id, an address or the name alone.
//!
//! # Why an entry cannot go stale
//!
//! A ShapeId names one immutable key list, one descriptor state and one
//! `[[Prototype]]` (#11342), and ShapeIds are never reused. So "`name` is own
//! data at inline slot `s`" is a fact of the word: a shadowing accessor, a
//! descriptor, a delete or a re-layout moves the receiver to another ShapeId
//! and the word stops matching. The one in-place change a ShapeId admits is a
//! stable-tombstone receiver's (#9064) hole, so a hit whose slot holds
//! `TAG_HOLE` is no answer. A hit says nothing about writability beyond the
//! key's attributes (an identity fact); a writer also refuses a frozen
//! receiver and stores through the field-representation funnel.
//!
//! The memo holds two integers per way and never a pointer, so it is not a
//! GC root. It is per thread, and so per agent, like the ShapeIds it holds.
