//! The read site's HOLDER entry: `o.k` where `k` is not an own key of the
//! receiver, answered by facts of two shapes.
//!
//! * The receiver's ShapeId `S` vouches that `k` is not own, that the receiver
//!   is an ordinary object, and its [[Prototype]] identity. A serial, default
//!   (the realm's `Object.prototype`), or MIXED explicit identity pins ONE
//!   object; null terminates the chain. A collecting accessor entry may
//!   also use a declared class identity: the registry link from a class to
//!   its declared prototype is written once, and a write that replaces or
//!   redirects it retires the displaced prototype's ShapeId
//!   (`class_registry::retire_displaced_decl_prototype`), so the holder-shape
//!   compare below sees the relink.
//! * The holder's ShapeId `SH` vouches that `k` is an own inline data slot of
//!   the holder `H` — or, for an ABSENT entry, that the terminal object lacks
//!   `k` and has a null [[Prototype]].
//! * For a holder deeper than the direct prototype, each intermediate hop's
//!   ShapeId vouches that the hop lacks `k` and still links to the next hop.
//!
//! Data/absence facts are compared on use without a global invalidation word:
//! a key add, delete, descriptor change or `setPrototypeOf` on any object
//! the entry names moves that object's ShapeId, and a value store to the
//! holder's slot is seen because the hit LOADS the slot. A delete is a shape
//! transition (#10826), so a holder whose ShapeId matches still has the slot:
//! the hit needs no `TAG_HOLE` test, as the emitted MRU hit needs none. The
//! collecting accessor route is the same two compares: the holder's ShapeId
//! declares the key an accessor lane (`ENTRY_ACCESSOR` in its key list), and
//! the hit loads the lane and compares it with the pair it was primed with,
//! which names the getter it then calls: a compiled class getter through its
//! code address, any other function object (a compiled function body or a
//! builtin thunk) through the closure ABI.
//!
//! The primary entry lives in `PicCache` words [`HOLDER_RECV`]..[`HOLDER_STATE`].
//! Eight further complete answers belong to the same site's bounded record.
//! Holders, hops and accessor pairs are strong roots, rewritten when they move
//! ([`scan_read_holder_roots_mut`]).
//!
//! # Emitted form
//!
//! Emitted code holds nothing of the entry. The read site's ShapeId compare
//! misses, and its one GC-leaf front call
//! (`field_get_set::ic_miss::read_confirm::js_object_get_field_ic_front`)
//! asks [`entry_answer`] after the ways, the spill entry and a latched site's
//! confirm, so an own-key read pays nothing for it. A decline is `TAG_HOLE`
//! and the site continues to the collecting slow call. The emitted getter arm
//! expands the shared guard program before calling user code with the
//! original receiver. Once a worker starts,
//! the front declines before reading any holder-entry word: the entry belongs
//! to the primary heap and no agent's GC scans it after the gate.
//!
//! # Priming
//!
//! Only from the primary agent's read miss handler, which already knows the key
//! is not own. Data and absent entries are recorded only after the generic
//! getter's answer agrees with the shapes. An accessor is published only
//! after its pair is validated, then its getter runs once. A worker
//! agent's start gates all further
//! holder hits and primes; stale entries stop being roots and can collect.
//!
//! A miss whose receiver a live entry already answers is served from the
//! entry and primes nothing. Complete answers for other receiver shapes use
//! bounded eviction in the existing site record. An unsupported receiver
//! leaves unrelated answers intact; it never permanently retires the site.
