/// #9754 memory. This used to be a `PtrHashMap<u64, SlotList>` per shape —
/// a 33-byte hashbrown bucket (`(u64, enum { One(u32), Many(Vec<u32>) })`
/// plus its control byte) for every key, in a power-of-two table. The
/// compiled claude-code TUI holds ~34.5k of these indices, one per keys array
/// past `KEYS_INDEX_THRESHOLD`, at **2.6 KB each: 89 MB** of the process's
/// 170 MB of side tables (`PERRY_GC_CENSUS`, 2026-09-04), while the objects
/// they describe are ~40 keys wide.
///
/// The table's only job is to answer "which slots might hold a key with this
/// hash" — every hit is then re-validated against the key BYTES
/// (`shape_slot_lookup_verdict`), so a wrong or colliding answer is a miss,
/// never a wrong property. That validation is what lets the stored hash be
/// narrow: a cell is a 16-bit tag (the top of a golden-ratio fold of the FNV-1a
/// hash) and a
/// 16-bit slot (`Narrow`, 4 bytes), widened to a 16-bit tag and a 32-bit slot
/// (`Wide`, 8 bytes) only for a shape with 65 535 or more keys. The probe
/// position is a function of the tag alone, so a cell can be re-placed from
/// its own bits when the table grows or is rebuilt after a delete. Same
/// hash, several slots (a genuine collision, or a note-hit under a stale
/// index) is just several cells with one tag on the probe chain. Load is
