//! Charter step 5 (P2): the runtime store check and the representation
//! transitions of a shape's fields (DESIGN §1.4 T3/T4, §1.5).
//!
//! A store into an inline slot whose shape says `F64` keeps the slot `F64`
//! when the value is a JS Number (stored as its canonical double: an INT32
//! box becomes its double, any NaN the canonical NaN). Any other value
//! GENERALIZES the slot before it is written:
//!
//! 1. the carried shape S marks the lane deprecated (`10`, a learned fact of
//!    the record, not identity), so the whole lineage learns it;
//! 2. T := the same facts with every deprecated lane (this one included)
//!    `Any`, found or minted through the one identity table (`by_facts`);
//! 3. the receiver's header gets T **first**, then the caller writes the
//!    value. No safepoint separates the two (§3.3): a collection between them
//!    would see the old Number under an `Any` lane, which the tag test
//!    ignores; the reverse order would show a pointer in an `F64` slot.
//!
//! Objects still carrying S keep a valid shape (every one of them holds a
//! Number at the lane), and converge on T on their next miss
//! ([`migrate_deprecated_receiver`]): one header store, no data movement,
//! because a raw-double Number IS a boxed Number.
//!
//! No per-object bit or side table is added. ConstFn body facts live in the
//! optional extension owned by that shape record; `by_facts` remains the
//! single identity table.
