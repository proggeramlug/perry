//! Computed string-key reads, `o[k]` with a runtime string `k` (#10753).
//!
//! A static read site holds its key's ATOM and compares the receiver's ShapeId
//! against its cache; a computed read has neither, so it used to resolve every
//! read by name: validate the key's UTF-8, hash it for the accessor Bloom,
//! classify the receiver, byte-compare the key against the shape's key list —
//! and, for a key the receiver lacks, repeat the whole generic Get on
//! `%Object.prototype%`. That was 808 instructions for a present key and about
//! 8,500 for an absent one.
//!
//! [`js_typed_feedback_object_get_field_by_key_f64`] answers from shapes first,
//! in this order, and only then takes the generic by-value entry:
//!
//! 1. **The receiver's shape, by key word.** The receiver's ShapeId (its `+4`
//!    word) names an ordinary record whose leading POSBOUND key positions ARE
//!    its inline slots; a canonical key list holds each key's ATOM, which is the
//!    very value a pooled key literal evaluates to, and a key taken from the
//!    list itself (`Object.keys`, `for…in`) is the list's own word. So the key
//!    is compared as one word per position, the megamorphic read front's
//!    confirm (`ic_miss::read_confirm`) without a site guess. A match is the
//!    property; a mismatch proves nothing (a non-atom string of the same text)
//!    and falls through.
//! 2. **The megamorphic read stub**, on the key's CONTENT bits: the own slots
//!    the generic lane and this entry prime (spill and overflow slots,
//!    non-atom keys), and the confirmed ABSENT verdicts this entry primes
//!    (below).
//! 3. **The receiver's own key list, once.** The same lookup that proves a key
//!    absent finds a present one: its slot is read and filed in the stub, so
//!    the generic Get never repeats the lookup for an own data key.
//!
//! # Absent keys
//!
//! An absent key is answered by the receiver's ShapeId plus
//! `%Object.prototype%`'s, the facts of a depth-1 ABSENT holder entry
//! (`method_site::read_holder`). Before the generic Get, the shapes are asked
//! whether they prove the key absent
//! (`read_holder::dynamic_absent_terminal`, allocation-free); after it, an
//! `undefined` answer files the verdict in the stub under the receiver's
//! token. Everything the verdict needs is a value — the token, the key's
//! content bits and the terminal ShapeId — so nothing is held across the Get,
//! which can collect.
//!
//! Every answer here is GC-free: no allocation, no collection, no user code.
