//! Agent-local authoritative object-shape descriptors (#8067).
//!
//! A shared `keys_array` already IS a shape (same pointer ⟹ same ordered
//! key list, because mutation always forks a private clone). This module
//! promotes that identity into an explicit per-shape key→slot table,
//! replacing two per-consumer tables that re-derived the same map:
//!
//! * `KEYS_INDEX` — keyed per OBJECT, so 10k same-shape siblings built 10k
//!   private indexes;
//! * `WIDE_KEY_INDEX` — keys-keyed but capped at a 4-entry LRU, so any
//!   working set past 4 wide shapes thrashed.
//!
//! The pointer-keyed key→slot index remains an accelerator: every hit still
//! re-validates the key bytes. Separately, every published `ShapeId` resolves
//! in this agent's `RuntimeState` to a descriptor containing the
//! ordered-keys edge plus the exact logical-key and live-inline-slot bounds.
//! The descriptor table is agent-local while ids are process-global. A live
//! object's ShapeId is authoritative for its ordered keys, logical-key count,
//! live inline-slot bound, and semantic generation. The one deliberately
//! mutable state is an owned ordinary object's #9064 stable-tombstone epoch:
//! per-slot `TAG_HOLE` validation lets its private keys array grow between
//! amortized squeezes without retiring unrelated cached slots.
//!
//! #8113 removed `ObjectHeader::field_count`, so the descriptor's
//! `live_inline_slot_count` is no longer a mirror of a header word — it is the
//! ONLY record of the bound. Every publication below is therefore
//! MINT-THEN-STAMP: the successor descriptor is fully installed while the
//! predecessor stamp is still readable, and the `parent_class_id` store is the
//! single, allocation-free publication point. A stamp-cleared window would be a
//! window in which the collector sees a live bound of 0 (#7154/#7164).
//! #8047 removed `ObjectHeader::keys_array`; consumers derive the edge from
//! this descriptor and no compatibility mirror remains.
