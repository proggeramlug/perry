//! `CreateDataPropertyOrThrow(O, key, value)` answered from the receiver
//! shape: the definition an object literal performs for each of its own
//! properties and a class performs for each public field.
//!
//! A definition never consults the prototype chain. On an ordinary,
//! extensible object it either creates `key` as a data property whose
//! attributes are all true, or, when `key` is already an own data property
//! with exactly those attributes, replaces its value. Both are facts of the
//! receiver ShapeId:
//!
//! 1. **Creation: the key-add edge.** The transition lattice holds an edge
//!    `(ShapeId, key) -> target` only for a shape that lacks `key`, so a hit
//!    is the creation, at the slot the target shape places the key. The edge
//!    is found by the ShapeId and the key's interned word, never by name.
//! 2. **Replacement: the own slot.** A key the shape already holds is
//!    overwritten in place when no own descriptor covers it.
//!
//! Anything else (no edge yet, an own accessor or non-default attributes for
//! the key, a non-extensible, exotic or dictionary receiver) is `None`, and
//! the caller runs the general definition, which also teaches the lattice the
//! edge for the next object of this shape.
//!
//! Nothing here runs user code. The only allocation is the store itself
//! (spill growth), and the stored value is handed back through the store's
//! own root.
