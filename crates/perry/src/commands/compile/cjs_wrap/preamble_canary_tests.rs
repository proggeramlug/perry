//! #7139 template-change canary: the CommonJS preamble this module emits must
//! stay recognisable to `perry-codegen`'s `collectors::cjs_scaffolding`.
//!
//! `Ptr<Shape>` rule 5 disables all shape promotion in a module containing any
//! `defineProperty`-family site. Two sites are exempted as module scaffolding:
//! the transpiler's `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", …)` and
//! **this file's own** `Object.defineProperty(require, 'name', …)` preamble
//! (`wrap.rs`, the `cjs_preamble` literal). The second one is emitted into
//! every wrapped module, so before #7139 it armed the barrier in 100 % of the
//! CommonJS dependency graph.
//!
//! The recogniser matches on binding name, initializer shape and property key.
//! Nothing links it to the template: rename the `require` local, change the
//! key, or bind it through anything other than a function declaration, and the
//! exemption silently stops applying. Nothing breaks, no test fails, and the
//! entire #7139 win evaporates with no symptom — the "gate that cannot fail"
//! shape CLAUDE.md documents.
//!
//! This canary closes that. It runs the real template through the real
//! recogniser: wrap → parse → lower → `module_has_ptr_shape_barrier`.
//!
//! #7152 adds the same coupling for the preamble's own ALLOCATIONS. The
//! recogniser there keys on the `__cjs_module` binding name, the
//! `{ exports: {} }` literal, and the `var module = __cjs_module` alias that
//! denies it — three more things this file's template controls and nothing
//! else checks. Its failure mode is quieter still: the report silently goes
//! back to charging Perry's own scaffolding to the user, which is what #7139
//! and #7149 both misread as evidence about dependency code.
