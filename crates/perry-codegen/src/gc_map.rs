//! Re-encode LLVM's stack-map section into Perry's compact GC map.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `gc.statepoint` metadata is the statepoint backend's *only* losing axis
//! against the shadow stack. Measured on `test-drizzle-pg`: generated `__text`
//! is 248 KB **smaller** under statepoints, but `__llvm_stackmaps` adds 3.9 MB,
//! so the binary loses by 3.5 MB overall.
//!
//! Almost none of those bytes carry information an AOT collector can use.
//! Measured composition of that section:
//!
//! * **60% of all location slots are `Constant`** — exactly three per record,
//!   `gc.statepoint`'s calling-convention / flags / num-deopt preamble.
//! * every root is recorded as a **(base, derived) pair**, and Perry has no
//!   interior pointers, so half of the remainder is the same slot twice;
//! * each record carries a 16-byte header whose 8-byte **patchpoint ID** only
//!   matters to a JIT that patches call sites, plus inter-record padding.
//!
//! The runtime already threw all of that away at startup (see
//! `perry-runtime/src/gc/roots/stack_maps.rs`): it kept `{dwarf_reg, offset}`
//! per distinct root and nothing else. This module simply stops shipping what
//! was always discarded.
//!
//! # Where the remaining win comes from
//!
//! Dropping the dead weight alone is ~11x. Two further facts about real
//! programs take it to ~32x:
//!
//! * roots within a record cluster in the frame, so **sorting by frame offset
//!   and delta-encoding** them makes most roots a single byte;
//! * **77% of records have exactly the live set of the record before them** —
//!   consecutive safepoints in a function usually share their roots — so a
//!   repeat flag replaces the whole payload.
//!
//! On drizzle: 4,214,384 B -> 131,402 B, which turns the 3.5 MB file-size loss
//! into a ~271 KB win and lets the statepoint backend lead on size, speed and
//! RSS simultaneously.
//!
//! # Why the rewrite happens on assembly rather than the object
//!
//! `clang -S` prints the stack map as ordinary directives with the function
//! addresses as **symbol names in plain text** (`.quad _main`). Rewriting there
//! needs one text parser. Rewriting the object instead would need Mach-O *and*
//! ELF relocation parsing (the addresses are external relocations), plus
//! `llvm-objcopy` to drop the old section, plus a second link pass.
//!
//! It costs almost nothing: `-S` takes the same time as `-c` (the codegen is
//! the cost; printing text is free), and assembling the result is ~0.02s.
