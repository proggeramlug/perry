//! The region guard itself (#10884) — one entry, shared by every slice.
//!
//! A region is a single-entry run of accesses over which one receiver's
//! `(unmasked pointer, ShapeId)` pair is held, entered through ONE shape
//! compare, whose failure leaves for a generic copy of the whole run and never
//! rejoins it (design doc §L7.1–L7.3). What varies between slices is only
//! WHERE the run is found and what is done with the loaded values:
//!
//! * slice 1 (`crate::expr::region_read_run`) — a run inside one `+` tree;
//! * slice 2 (`crate::stmt::region_read_stmts`) — a run across statements.
//!
//! Everything else — the state word, R1, R2, the bounded prime, the miss
//! edges — lives here, so the two slices cannot drift into two guards with two
//! soundness arguments. The emitted sequence is:
//!
//! ```text
//! [R1] guard   fused receiver test + ONE ShapeId compare    ─┐ the only two
//! [R2] load    every key's slot, from one atomic region word │ bail edges,
//!              (a slice may then verify, then use)          ─┘ before any effect
//! ```
//!
//! # Supplier
//!
//! The expected ShapeId is learned (supplier (b), §L14.18.4): a per-region
//! atomic word primed on a miss by `js_region_guard_prime`. The id and every
//! key's slot live in ONE word so a concurrent prime can never pair one
//! shape's id with another's slots. A link-time constant (step 4) would
//! replace the word load and nothing else.
//!
//! # The miss price, measured
//!
//! A region that never hits costs **~19 instructions per execution**: 17 for
//! this prologue (it must materialise the operands before the compare can
//! exist) and 3 for the retirement bookkeeping, which every miss pays even
//! after priming retires. Measured with the kill switch on an `Object.create`
//! receiver, whose fields spill and therefore can never pack a word:
//! `ocr2` 75 → 94, `ocr4` 450 → 470, against `lit4` (same source, literal
//! receiver) 216 → 53. Price a guard by everything that must execute to reach
//! its branch, not by the branch (§L7.6.3).
