//! #5093: codegen-inlined class-field shape guard.
//!
//! Monomorphic `this.field` reads/writes on a known class instance previously
//! routed every access through a cross-crate
//! `js_typed_feedback_class_field_{get,set}_guard` *call* before touching the
//! raw slot. Measurements in #5093 showed the call itself — not its body — was
//! the dominant cost on the `09_method_calls` benchmark (~290× Node). This
//! emits the cheap part of the guard's contract as inline IR: when the
//! monomorphic shape holds (and, for raw-f64 fields, the per-object typed-layout
//! intact bit is set), control branches straight to the fast slot load/store,
//! skipping the call.
//!
//! NOTE (repsel Phase 3b audit, verified with `--trace llvm` + `opt -O3` on a
//! `this.field`-in-loop method): LLVM LICM does NOT hoist this check out of
//! hot loops. The volatile gate load is never hoistable (volatile ⇒
//! `!isUnordered`), and — decisively — even a plain or `atomic unordered`
//! gate load stays in the loop because the diamond's own guard-call/fallback
//! arm puts an unknown external call inside the loop body, which
//! clobber-blocks LICM for every load in the check. Per-access cost is
//! therefore paid on every iteration. The hoisted form exists as the #5093
//! region preheader checks (`stmt::region_loop`), and statically-proven receivers
//! skip the diamond entirely (`collectors/ptr_shape.rs`). Do not "fix" this
//! by de-volatilizing the gate: it buys nothing (the calls still block LICM)
//! and weakens the mid-loop sticky-flip visibility guarantee for loops whose
//! bodies CAN flip the gate through a call.
//!
//! The inline check is a strict subset of `class_field_fast_contract` (runtime
//! `typed_feedback/guards.rs`): if it passes, the guard call would have returned
//! "fast". On any miss it falls through to the unchanged guard-call path, so the
//! optimization is purely additive — it can never take the fast path the guard
//! would have rejected. The exact ShapeId carries the raw-f64 lane rep, so a
//! representation change must move to a different ShapeId before this guard
//! can pass again.

/// `Node2D`'s constructor is only ever reached through `super(...)` from a
/// subclass, so the class-id compare fails on every single store and each
/// `this.x = x` pays a full by-name `js_put_value_set`. The same holds for every

/// ## Why it is sound
///
/// `class_field_global_index` lays a class out as its init chain's keyable
/// fields, root → leaf — parent fields first — so an inherited field keeps its
/// index in every subclass. That is a property of the layout algorithm, not a
/// promise, so this **re-derives the index for each candidate** and drops any
/// subclass that disagrees (a shadowing re-declaration lands at its own slot,
/// and an accessor anywhere on the chain makes `class_field_global_index`
/// return `None`). The raw-f64 candidacy of the declared type is likewise
/// re-checked per subclass: the fast path reads/writes the slot as a bare
/// double, and the per-object typed-layout intact bit only licenses that for a

///   DYNAMIC: the `delete` shape barrier that stands the analysis down is
///   module-scoped while receivers alias across modules (#7143), so no static
///   proof is available at this site.
/// * **Per-object `OBJ_FLAG_HAS_DESCRIPTORS`** — instance-level descriptor
///   installs deliberately do NOT flip the process-global latch (#5654), so
///   they are vetted per receiver, exactly as the per-access check does.
/// * **`OBJ_FLAG_FROZEN`** — a proven-receiver clone may contain field WRITES,
///   and a guard-free raw store into a frozen receiver would silently succeed
///   where the spec requires a strict-mode `TypeError`. The clone's own
///   admission rules this out only through a MODULE-scoped freeze-barrier kill,

/// Emit the class-field READ guard: receiver range check, ONE ShapeId compare

/// only — the class id and the per-object typed-layout intact bit.
///
/// Hit path on x86-64 (`class P { a; getA() { return this.a } }`): a boxed
/// field is `lea`/`shr`/`cmp`/`jae` (range), `mov` expectation, `cmp` against
/// `+4`, `jne`, load; a raw-f64 field adds the class id to the compare
/// (`shl`/`or` building the 64-bit word) and a one-byte `testb`/`je` of the
/// intact bit. The pre-split guard spent 11 instructions on a flat
/// tag+handle predicate and 4 on a GcHeader word mask before its compare.
///
/// This is the read-side form of [`emit_class_field_inline_precheck`], and it
/// is deliberately a separate function: the WRITE guard keeps the full header
/// word test for `OBJ_FLAG_FROZEN`. The exact ShapeId comparison rejects
/// the Array-subclass numeric-proof sibling.
///
/// ## What a matching ShapeId already proves (the checks this guard dropped)
///
/// The generic read IC (`property_get/generic_dispatch.rs`, "No GC-header
/// load, no descriptor-flag test") dropped the same header predicates on the
/// same arguments; each is held by runtime tests in
/// `perry-runtime/src/object/shape_rules_tests.rs` / `shape_rule3.rs`:
///
/// * **`obj_type == GC_TYPE_OBJECT`** — rule 3 (#10828): no POINTER-tagged
///   non-object cell holds a value in the ShapeId range at payload `+4`. The
///   expectation is the class's ShapeId, so a match proves an ordinary object.
/// * **not `GC_FLAG_FORWARDED`** — `set_forwarding_address` (`gc/types.rs`)
///   overwrites payload `+0..8` with the new address, so a forwarded cell's
///   `+4` word is the high half of a heap address, `<= 0xFFFF` under
///   `MAX_HEAP_ADDR_EXCLUSIVE` (the `StructurallySmall` argument of rule 3),
///   far below the ShapeId floor.
/// * **no `OBJ_FLAG_HAS_DESCRIPTORS`** — rule 1 (#10824): every descriptor
///   install / removal / clear on a shaped ordinary object goes through
///   `note_descriptor_target_keyed`, which transitions the shape onto a
///   semantic successor lineage. The class ShapeId is the one module init
///   minted for the class's canonical key list and stamped on every instance
///   at birth, so a receiver still carrying it has had no descriptor change.
/// * **no `OBJ_FLAG_STABLE_TOMBSTONES`** — #10826: every successful `delete`
///   is a shape transition, so a receiver at the class ShapeId holds no hole
///   in any slot of that shape.
/// * **unstamped receivers** — rule 2: nothing but the shape allocator mints
///   into the ShapeId range, so a `parent_class_id` at `+4` cannot match.
/// * **the slot** — the expectation is the ShapeId of the class's canonical
///   keys array, whose key order IS `class_field_global_index`'s layout, so a
///   match proves `property` is an own data property at `field_index` —
///   whatever the receiver's class id. A boxed read therefore needs nothing
///   else: it returns the slot as a JS value, exactly what the generic IC
///   returns for the same ShapeId and slot.
///
/// ## What it does NOT prove (the checks this guard keeps)
///
/// * **The receiver range check** — nothing may be dereferenced before it.
///
/// ## What it no longer consults (S6)
///
/// The expectation used to be a poisonable twin of the class ShapeId,
/// `@perry_class_guard_shape_*`, which `disable_class_field_inline_guard`
/// overwrote with `u32::MAX` — a process switch saying "do not trust the
/// shape". Its triggers were a prototype-level accessor on a declared field
/// name, typed-feedback tracing, `PERRY_VERIFY_TYPED_INTACT` and the
/// `PERRY_DISABLE_CLASS_FIELD_INLINE` knob. None of them changes the answer
/// this read gives: a class instance carries every declared field as an OWN
/// data property from birth (the canonical keys array), and an own data
/// property shadows any prototype accessor (scenario 3 of
/// `test-files/test_gap_5654_class_field_inline_descriptor.ts`; the generic
/// IC, which never had a switch, gives the same answer for the same ShapeId
/// and slot). The other three are diagnostics that only decided whether the
/// guard CALL observed the access.
/// * **raw-f64 sites: the class id.** A class whose layout has no pointer
///   slot mints its ShapeId from the key list alone
///   (`js_object_shape_id_for_keys`, `codegen/string_pool.rs`), so an object
///   literal or another class with the same keys in the same order shares
///   it — and may hold a string where this class declares `number`. Only the
///   class id tells the raw-f64 read that the declared type is the one that
///   applies. Measured on the 2.5 base: `class SamePt { x: number; y:
///   number }`, `class BoolPt { x: boolean; y: number }` and `class SubPt
///   extends Pt {}` instances all carry `Pt`'s ShapeId, each with its own
///   class id (scenario 1 of
///   `test-files/test_gap_class_field_read_guard_shape_authority.ts`).
/// * **raw-f64 sites: exact ShapeId birth rep.** The compared id carries
///   the F64 lane fact; a contradictory store moves to a sibling id.
///
/// On success the IR branches to `fast_label`; on any miss to a fresh
/// `class_field_inline.guardcall` block, which is left current (the caller
/// emits the unchanged miss call there). Returns `(guardcall_label,
/// obj_handle)`: the handle is derived from the range check's subtraction and
/// is the one the fast block must address the slot through.
