//! PropertySet (obj.prop = v).
//!
//! Extracted from `expr/mod.rs` to keep that file under the 2000-line cap.
//! Pure mechanical move — match arm bodies are verbatim copies, called from
//! `lower_expr`'s outer dispatch.
//!
//! # Rooting (Layer 1, slice 4)
//!
//! Migrated onto [`crate::rooting`]; this module names no `expr::temp_root`
//! symbol. Every store here is the same shape — the receiver is lowered first
//! because `Set(O, k, v)` evaluates the reference before the value, so it sits
//! in an SSA register while arbitrary user code runs — and that shape is
//! exactly one call to [`crate::rooting::with_operands_rooted`] (the value is
//! lowered by `lower_expr`) or
//! [`crate::rooting::with_operands_rooted_across`] (the value is lowered by
//! `lower_value_for_dynamic_property_set`, which this API cannot produce).
//! The class-field family has one deliberate split: `LocalGet` / `This`
//! receivers keep their existing zero-cost `root_reload` repair, while a
//! compound receiver uses an operand group because that pass cannot rederive
//! its phi result (#7640 section C).
//!
//! The migration found one arm that had no guard at all: `arr.length = f()`
//! (#7637). It is the same #7154 window every sibling arm already closed, and
//! it is closed here by putting the receiver in an operand group rather than by
//! a fourth hand-written guard.

///
/// The fast arm never needed the bail. The #5093 inline precheck
/// (`emit_class_field_inline_precheck`) already rejects every receiver whose
/// store could be *rejected* — `OBJ_FLAG_FROZEN`, `OBJ_FLAG_HAS_DESCRIPTORS`, a
/// mismatched class id or keys token, a cleared typed-layout-intact bit — plus
/// every value that is not a plain finite number, and the process-global gate
/// is flipped by any prototype-level descriptor install naming a declared
/// field. A store that reaches the raw slot is therefore one that could not
/// have been rejected in either mode, so the fast arm is mode-independent.
/// Only the fallback needed strict-awareness, and this sends every miss to
/// `js_put_value_set(..., strict = 0)` — the sloppy-correct runtime the
/// surrounding `PutValueSet` lowering already uses — instead of the throwing
/// by-name setter.
///
/// Scope: a declared field on a known class, receiver == target — raw-f64
/// (`number`) slots and boxed slots alike.
///
/// The boxed half is P1 (#5094). #7288 originally took only the raw-f64 slots
/// because "boxed slots need the layout note and write barrier that the
/// guard-call path emits" — but those are emitted by
/// [`emit_jsvalue_slot_store_pointer_tested`], not by the guard, and this arm
/// calls it with the identical value-side predicates the strict arm uses. What
/// the guard call actually contributes is descriptor-aware dispatch and the
/// setter-in-chain walk, and the inline precheck refuses every receiver that
/// needs either.
///
/// Leaving the boxed slots out was the more expensive half of the omission:
/// a `next: LNode | null` store fell through to the `PutValue` write IC
/// (`expr/proxy_reflect.rs`), whose miss path is `js_put_value_set` →
/// `js_object_set_field_by_name` — by-name dispatch, a `RuntimeHandleScope`,
