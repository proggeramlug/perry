//! Charter step 4b (#10884): LOOP regions and per-iteration (loop-body)
//! regions. Design: `/root/linktime/DESIGN.md` §3.0–§3.2 (approved
//! 2026-09-28).
//!
//! # What this does
//!
//! A loop whose body reads or writes static keys of a receiver that cannot
//! change inside the loop (`this`, or a parameter / local no closure mutates
//! and the loop never assigns) is entered through ONE guard per receiver, in
//! the preheader:
//!
//! ```text
//! preheader:  receiver test + ONE ShapeId compare against the region word
//!             (+ the two per-object store facts, when the region stores)
//!             -> valid (an i1 slot) and the region word's slot vector
//! body top:   !valid                 -> G-body (today's lowering)
//!             [body can re-enter JS] valid := ([p+4] == S) && no-proof
//!             F-body                  (facts: bare loads / stores)
//! ```
//!
//! Only the BODY is lowered twice; the loop's own mechanics (counter
//! representation, condition, update, polls) are lowered once by whichever
//! tier takes the loop, so no tier needs a hand-off protocol (DESIGN §3.0).
//! F-body and G-body rejoin at the latch. That is sound because a fact is
//! used only inside F-body, and F-body is entered only when `valid` was
//! established by the guard or the re-check with no JS in between: the
//! re-check sits at the TOP of every iteration.
//!
//! A per-iteration receiver (`const o = objs[k & 7]; o.d = k; ...`) gets the
//! same split for the TAIL of the body after its binding, with the full guard
//! at the tail's top every iteration (no `valid` slot).
//!
//! # Which accesses are bare
//!
//! [`plan`] is the planner and the census in one pass (DESIGN §3.4): it walks
//! the body in JS evaluation order with the facts FRESH at the split point, and
//! anything that can run JS — a call, `new`, a coercion of an unproven operand,
//! another receiver's access (a getter), an index access, a non-bare store —
//! makes them STALE for the rest of the iteration. An access reached FRESH is
//! bare; every other access is today's tower. After lowering, [`verify`]
//! recomputes the same fact state over the EMITTED blocks from the calls that
//! were actually emitted; a bare access reachable after a call that may run JS
//! discards F-body (the split then branches to G-body unconditionally). A plan
//! that is wrong can cost speed, never a value.
//!
//! # GC
//!
//! No pointer is held across anything: every bare access re-derives the
//! receiver handle from the binding's root (`load; bitcast; and POINTER_MASK`
//! — a derivation `root_reload.rs` and the gc-root-dominance checker both
//! track), and LLVM merges re-derivations inside collection-free stretches. S
//! and the slots are plain integers.
