/// by-name `js_class_field_set_fallback` each, since a fresh instance has no

///
/// **What the elided write is NOT** (the obvious objection, and it is

/// an accessor runs. A class field declaration is a `CreateDataProperty` — a

///   the skipped slot stays unobservable. What this condition excludes is the
///   class having its OWN super machinery in between.
/// - **No field anywhere on the class carries an initializer expression or a
///   computed key, and the class and its fields are undecorated.** Initializer
///   and key expressions run during the init phase and may legally read
///   `this.<f>` of an earlier field — eliding f's `undefined` write would let
///   them observe whatever the allocator left in the slot. All-`init: None`
///   fields mean the init phase contains no user expression at all.
/// - **Every constructor parameter is plain**: no default (a default expression
///   evaluates before the prologue and, in the general lowering, could observe
///   `this`), no rest, no decorators, no `arguments` materialization.
/// - **No setter shares a name with a prologue-assigned field** — the store
///   would dispatch to the setter instead of writing the slot, and the elided
///   `undefined` write was the only slot write.
/// - The field itself is public and non-computed (`is_private` false,
///   `key_expr` none).
///
/// The prologue is the maximal leading run of statements that
/// [`prologue_assigned_field`] recognizes as `this.<f> = <expr that cannot

        // real constructor overwrites moments later.

        // It does NOT hold for the private BRAND. The stub copies private
        // METHOD and accessor names verbatim (it needs them to resolve dispatch
        // symbols), and `has_private_instance_brand` is defined purely over
        // `#`-prefixed method/getter/setter names — so a stub answers `true` and
