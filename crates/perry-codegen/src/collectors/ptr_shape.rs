//! Representation-selection Phase 3b (RFC `docs/representation-selection-rfc.md`
//! §4 Object row, §5.5-§5.7): shape-proven object locals (`Ptr<Shape>`).
//!
//! ## What this proves
//!
//! A function-local `let o = new C(...)` qualifies as a **shape-proven pointer
//! local** when static analysis proves that the object's shape (class identity,
//! key set, field layout, descriptor-free-ness, method table) cannot change for
//! the local's entire lifetime. Every field access on such a local then lowers
//! to the bare fixed-offset form — `load i64` slot, `and` POINTER_MASK, `gep
//! +header`, `gep` index, `load` — with **no per-access guard diamond** (no
//! volatile gate load, no 7-header-load shape check, no
//! `js_typed_feedback_class_field_*_guard` fallback arm, no `phi`), and method
//! calls on it lower to a **direct call with no shape guard**.
//!
//! ## Why it is sound without the runtime invalidators
//!
//! Today's guarded fast path is per-SITE and runtime-checked: the process-global
//! sticky gate (`PERRY_CLASS_FIELD_INLINE_GUARD_DISABLED`), the per-object
//! descriptor flag, and prototype-guard invalidation exist because a receiver
//! at an arbitrary site can be *any* object. A `Ptr<Shape>` local is instead
//! proven by **provenance + containment**:
//!
//! 1. **Provenance**: the local is initialized by exactly one `Stmt::Let` whose
//!    init is `new C(...)` — its dynamic class is *exactly* `C` (Perry class
//!    constructors cannot return an override object). Anon-shape literals
//!    (`{k: v}` closed shapes) and `{}` builder sites also lower to
//!    `Expr::New { class_name: "__AnonShape_…" }`, so records qualify through
//!    the same test. Since #7034 §4 a direct call to a module function
//!    carrying a **return-shape fact** is provenance of the same strength —
//!    that fact certifies the callee hands back a freshly allocated, unaliased
//!    `C` on every return path (`collectors/ptr_shape_returns.rs`).
//!    **One seed is suppressed** (#7152, `collectors/cjs_scaffolding.rs`):
//!    `cjs_wrap`'s own `const __cjs_module = { exports: {} }`, and only in a
//!    region that also binds the `var module = __cjs_module` alias that denies
//!    it under rule 2 — so it removes a value this walk would disqualify
//!    anyway. It was 31 % of all candidates on real dependency JS.
//! 2. **Containment**: every use of the local is a declared-chain field
//!    read/write/update or a vetted method call. Any other use — reassignment,
//!    closure capture, call argument, array/object element, throw,
//!    `delete`, freeze/seal, aliasing — disqualifies. The object is therefore
//!    unreachable from anywhere except this local, so no §5.2 barrier
//!    (defineProperty / delete / setPrototypeOf / Proxy / mutating Reflect)
//!    can reach it *through an alias*.
//!
//!    **Exception — the array-element position (#7034 §3).** `A.push(<the
//!    local>)` does NOT disqualify when `A` is an **element-shape-proven
//!    local array** (`collectors/ptr_shape_elements.rs`): that analysis bounds
//!    the array's own uses exactly as this rule bounds an object local's, so
//!    the containment region widens from one local to one local array and
//!    everything derived from it. `const r = A[i]` at an in-bounds site is
//!    provenance of the same `new`-strength for the same reason. Group
//!    integrity is enforced at the end of the `'cand` loop: if any member of
//!    an element group fails rule 2, every member is dropped, because one
//!    member adding a property reshapes the objects the others read.
//!
//!    **Exception — the return position (#7034 §4).** `return <the local>`
//!    does NOT disqualify. Containment exists to bound the object's aliases
//!    *while this function still reads it*, and a `return` is a terminator:
//!    every use of the local in this body either precedes it on that path or
//!    is unreachable from it, the sole exception being a `finally` block —
//!    which still runs before the caller resumes, and whose uses this same
//!    walk checks anyway. The caller cannot have touched the object yet, so
//!    no shape transition can have happened at any access this pass licenses.
//!    Returns nested inside a CLOSURE body are not exempt: that value escapes
//!    at an unbounded later time (`UseWalk::in_closure`).
//! 3. **`this`-flow containment**: the constructor chain, chain field
//!    initializers, and every method called on the local are walked with a
//!    strict `this`-usage discipline (field access on `this`, vetted
//!    `this.m()` / `super` chains only). Any leak of `this` as a value —
//!    which would create an alias the escape walk cannot see — disqualifies.
//! 4. **Dispatch stability**: method calls additionally require
//!    [`ModuleDispatchFacts::prototype_is_stable`] (the same module-level scan
//!    shipped for scalar-replacement method summaries, #5872) and no
//!    own-property write that could shadow the method (subsumed by rule 2:
//!    writes to non-declared-field names disqualify).
//! 5. **Module-wide unbounded-barrier policy (first increment)**: if the
//!    module contains *any* `Object.defineProperty`-family site, `delete`,
//!    `setPrototypeOf`/`__proto__` write, `Proxy` construction, or mutating
//!    `Reflect.*` call — regardless of target — ALL `Ptr<Shape>` promotion in
//!    the module is disabled (`ModuleDispatchFacts::shape_barrier_sites`).
//!    Rules 1-4 already bound every path to the object, so this module-wide
//!    kill is belt-and-braces against analysis blind spots; it is the
//!    conservative first-increment rule from the RFC §5.2 discussion and
//!    still covers the common barrier-free module. (`eval` needs no kill:
//!    Perry never executes a runtime code string — see
//!    `perry-hir/src/eval_classifier.rs`.) Phase 5a consults this same
//!    per-module fact as a COST HEURISTIC only: its receiver is aliased across
//!    modules by construction, so its call sites carry runtime keys-token
//!    guards instead. Here, rule 2's containment IS the correctness argument
//!    (#7143, `collectors/proven_this.rs`).
//!
//!    **One exemption** (#7139, `collectors/cjs_scaffolding.rs`): the two
//!    `defineProperty` sites every `cjs_wrap`-compiled CommonJS module
//!    carries — Perry's own preamble `Object.defineProperty(require, 'name',
//!    …)` and the transpiler's `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule",
//!    …)` — target module scaffolding whose every binding initializer is a
//!    field read, a function value, or nothing, so rule 1 can never seed it
//!    and rule 2's containment keeps every promoted object out of it. That
//!    initializer test is a whitelist, so widening rule 1's seed set (#7034
//!    §4's return-shape calls) cannot silently widen the exemption. Nothing
//!    else is exempt: any other target, any other key, a computed key, or any
//!    other barrier family still arms the kill.
//!
//! ## Numeric-proven fields
//!
//! For the READ side to keep today's `JsNumber`/`NativeRep::F64` semantics on a
//! bare `load double`, the analysis additionally proves per raw-f64-declared
//! field that **every reachable store** (constructor, chain field initializers,
//! method bodies, and in-function stores — an exhaustive set, by rule 2) is
//! number-producing by construction. Constructor/method parameter stores are
//! resolved through the actual argument expressions at the provenance `new` /
//! call sites. Fields that fail keep the bare load but surface as generic
//! `JsValue` (bit-identical — a NaN-boxed number IS its own double bits).
//! Store-side raw-slot discipline (plain-finite check + boxed-setter side
//! exit) is emitted at the access site regardless, so a NaN/Inf/non-number
//! store can never corrupt a scalar-masked slot the GC does not scan.
//!
//! ## GC contract (tagged-at-rest)
//!
//! The local's storage is untouched: the existing NaN-boxed slot, registered
//! as a rewritable root via `js_shadow_slot_bind` (the GC marks and rewrites
//! **through the bound alloca**, `gc/roots/shadow_stack.rs`). The raw pointer
//! is region-local SSA only: every access re-derives it from the slot, and
//! because the slot address escapes to the shadow-stack registry, LLVM cannot
//! CSE the reload across a safepoint — rebase-after-safepoint (RFC §5.6) falls
//! out of alias analysis. Raw pointers are never stored at rest.
//!
//! Gated by `PERRY_PTR_SHAPE_LOCALS` (default on; `0`/`off`/`false` disables —
//! keyed into the object cache). `PERRY_REPSEL_DEBUG=1` prints one line per
//! proven local at compile time.
