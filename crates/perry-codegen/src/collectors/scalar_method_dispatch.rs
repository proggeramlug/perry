//! Dispatch-stability facts for the scalar-replacement method summary (#5872).
//!
//! [`simple_scalar_method_summary`](super::simple_scalar_method_summary) proves
//! that a method *body* is a numeric expression over `this.<field>`. Scalar
//! replacement of the receiver needs a second, independent proof: that
//! `obj.m(...)` still RESOLVES to that class method at the call site. JS lets
//! user code break the lookup after the object is constructed:
//!
//! * an own-property write shadows the prototype method — `(obj as any).m =
//!   () => 99` wins over `C.prototype.m`;
//! * a prototype mutation replaces the method — `C.prototype.m = fn`,
//!   `Object.defineProperty(C.prototype, "m", …)`, `let p = C.prototype; p.m =
//!   fn` — and it can happen in *another* function, in a constructor, or in a
//!   field initializer, i.e. nowhere near the `new`.
//!
//! Before #5466 codegen escaped every receiver that reached a method call, so
//! neither could bite: the perry-transform exact-receiver inliner was the only
//! layer that folded `obj.m()` into a field read, and it invalidates its facts
//! on exactly those mutations. #5466 taught codegen's escape check to keep a
//! summarized receiver scalar-replaced, but the summary only inspects the class
//! *declaration* — so a post-construction shadow was invisible and `obj.m()`
//! folded to the field value (#5872: `ownMethodWrite()` returned 14, not 99).
//!
//! Two fact sets restore the missing half:
//!
//! * [`ModuleDispatchFacts`] — module-scoped: which classes' prototypes are
//!   named anywhere in the module. Naming is normally enough, because a named
//!   prototype can be aliased and written through. The one exception is a
//!   fully-contained, immutable alias used only by the lowered
//!   `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(proto)` / `typeof proto[key]` /
//!   `proto[key].bind(...)` introspection pattern; that pattern never exposes
//!   or mutates the prototype object. A per-function mutation walk cannot see
//!   this; the mutation typically lives in a helper the constructor calls.
//! * [`collect_candidate_property_writes`] — function-scoped: which property
//!   names are written directly on each scalar-replacement candidate.
//!
//! Both are deliberately narrow: they only ever *remove* a receiver from the
//! scalar-replaced set, and only when it is the target of a summarized method
//! call. Plain field scalar replacement is untouched.
