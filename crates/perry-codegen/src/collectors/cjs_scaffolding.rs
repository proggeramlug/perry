//! CommonJS module-scaffolding `Object.defineProperty` sites (#7139).
//!
//! Narrows the `Ptr<Shape>` rule-5 module-wide barrier
//! ([`super::ptr_shape`] doc, rule 5) so that the two `defineProperty` calls
//! every `cjs_wrap`-compiled CommonJS module contains — neither of them
//! anything to do with user objects — stop disabling shape promotion for the
//! whole module.
//!
//! ## The two sites
//!
//! 1. **Perry's own CJS preamble.** `cjs_wrap` emits
//!    `Object.defineProperty(require, 'name', { value: 'require', … })` into
//!    *every* wrapped module (`perry/src/commands/compile/cjs_wrap/wrap.rs`,
//!    the `cjs_preamble` literal). This alone means **100 %** of the
//!    CommonJS dependency graph carried `shape_barrier_sites = true`
//!    regardless of what the package source does.
//! 2. **The transpiled-CJS interop marker.**
//!    `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true })` — the
//!    single line tsc/Babel/esbuild put at the top of every emitted CJS file.
//!
//! Exempting only (2) would have recovered nothing, because (1) fires first
//! and unconditionally. Both are recognised here, and nothing else is.
//!
//! ## Predicate
//!
//! An `Expr::ObjectDefineProperty(target, key, desc)` node is exempt iff
//!
//! * `target` is `Expr::LocalGet(id)`;
//! * the module binds `id` with a `Stmt::Let` named `exports` (resp.
//!   `require`);
//! * **every** `Stmt::Let` binding of `id` in the module has an initializer in
//!   [`init_is_never_a_seed`]'s whitelist (`PropertyGet` / `Closure` /
//!   `Undefined` / absent);
//! * `key` is the string literal `"__esModule"` (resp. `"name"`).
//!
//! Every other `defineProperty` target, every other key, every computed key,
//! and every other barrier family (`delete`, `setPrototypeOf` / `__proto__`
//! write, `new Proxy`, mutating `Reflect.*`) keep the module-wide kill
//! untouched.
//!
//! ## Why it is sound
//!
//! A `defineProperty` can only invalidate a `Ptr<Shape>` local's proof if the
//! object it mutates *is* the object that local holds. Two independent facts
//! rule that out:
//!
//! * **The target is not a candidate.** `Ptr<Shape>` candidates are seeded by
//!   [`super::find_new_candidates`] from `Stmt::Let { init: Some(Expr::New
//!   { .. }), .. }`. The third clause above admits only initializers that are
//!   not fresh allocations at all — a field read, a function value, or nothing
//!   — so an exempted target can never be promoted, and, being a whitelist,
//!   it stays true if the seed set widens (#7034 §4's return-shape calls).
//!   The check is on the HIR, not on an expectation about the wrap template,
//!   so a future template change degrades to *no exemption* rather than to an
//!   unsound one.
//! * **No promoted object can reach the target.** Rule 2 (containment) admits
//!   a local only when *every* use of it is a declared-chain field
//!   read/write/update or a vetted method call; reassignment, aliasing,
//!   capture, and passing it as a call/constructor argument all disqualify.
//!   A promoted object therefore never flows into another binding, so it can
//!   never be the value of `exports` or `require`.
//!
//! The descriptor argument is deliberately unconstrained. A descriptor is a
//! plain value; if it contains an accessor closure, that closure's body is a
//! `Vec<Stmt>` the module barrier walk descends into on its own
//! (`for_each_expr` recurses through `Expr::Closure`), so a barrier *inside*
//! a descriptor still sets the flag.
//!
//! The flag this feeds (`ModuleDispatchFacts::shape_barrier_sites`) is also
//! read by `ptr_numarray` and `proven_this`. The argument above is about the
//! identity of the mutated object, not about which analysis consults the
//! flag, so it carries over unchanged: `exports` and `require` are likewise
//! never `Ptr<NumArray>` locals nor proven-`this` receivers.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # The preamble's own ALLOCATIONS (#7152)
//!
//! Everything above is about the rule-5 barrier. [`preamble_in_region`] is
//! about a different self-inflicted wound in the same template: the objects
//! the preamble *allocates* are counted as `Ptr<Shape>` candidates and then
//! denied, in every CommonJS module, and on real dependency code they are the
//! majority of the report.
//!
//! Measured over 195 `__esModule` CJS modules from `scriptc/node_modules`:
//! 136 of the 140 rule-2 "bare reference" denials, 55 of the 187 rule-5
//! denials, and 188 of the 194 "constructor argument" unbound-allocation
//! denials are one of these two statements — 379 rows, ~2 per module, 31 % of
//! every `Ptr<Shape>` candidate in the corpus. #7139 read its share of them as
//! "containment is the wall in dependency JS" and scheduled #7149 on it; #7152
//! re-measured and put the wall at rule 1. Both readings were partly about
//! Perry's own scaffolding.
//!
//! ## What is recognised
//!
//! One **region** (a lowered statement list — the `cjs_wrap` IIFE's body, or
//! module init on the flat path) is a CommonJS preamble when its top level
//! carries all four of:
//!
//! * **R1** `Stmt::Let` named `__cjs_module`, `mutable: false`, initialized by
//!   an `Expr::New` of an `__AnonShape_…` class (an object literal);
//! * **R2** that literal is `{ exports: {} }` — one field whose value is an
//!   argument-less `__AnonShape_…` allocation — or one of the two folded
//!   wrapper templates (eight or eleven fixed fields) that lowering produces
//!   when `wrap.rs` emits the record as a single object literal;
//! * **R3** exactly one top-level statement satisfying R1+R2, so "the record"
//!   is unambiguous;
//! * **R4** the same top level binds `var module = __cjs_module` —
//!   `Stmt::Let { mutable: true, init: LocalGet(<the record>) }`.
//!
//! Then, and only then, three things stop being reported: the record local
//! itself, the `{}` inside it, and the object literals of the preamble
//! statements [`CjsPreamble::stmt_allocates_only_scaffolding`] names.
//!
//! ## Why it is sound
//!
//! **This is a candidate SUPPRESSION, not a proof relaxation** — the opposite
//! direction from the barrier exemption above. Dropping a candidate can only
//! remove facts, never add one, so it cannot make codegen unsound; the entire
//! obligation is to show it never removes a fact that would otherwise exist.
//!
//! **R4 discharges that obligation outright.** It is not a heuristic about
//! the template, it is the denial itself: a `Stmt::Let` whose init is a bare
//! `Expr::LocalGet` of the record, with `mutable: true` so the alias pre-pass
//! in `ptr_shape.rs` refuses to track it, walks into `UseWalk`'s `LocalGet`
//! arm under the default escape context and disqualifies the record with
//! `ESC_BARE_REFERENCE` on every path. A region satisfying R4 therefore
//! *cannot* promote its record, so removing it from the candidate set leaves
//! the returned `HashMap` bit-identical. R1-R3 only make the recognition
//! unambiguous; they carry no soundness weight, and if any of them drifts the
//! candidate simply reappears in the report.
//!
//! And the escape R4 names is not incidental to the template — it is load
//! bearing. `var module` is what CommonJS bodies write `module.exports = X`
//! through, and the preamble goes on to store it into `require.main`. The
//! record is genuinely, permanently escaped; there is no narrowing of rule 2
//! that could promote it, which is why this is a suppression and not an
//! exemption.
//!
//! The allocation-site half is **report-only** in the strongest sense:
//! `ptr_shape_report::unbound_new_sites` is called exclusively under
//! `opt_report::enabled()`, and its output feeds nothing but the report.
