//! Re-read a shadow slot below every collection point that can run under it
//! (#7280).
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! `docs/src/internals/gc-rooting-invariant.md` states it, and the second half
//! is the half that keeps getting dropped:
//!
//! > Any GC-managed value that is live across a collection point must be
//! > reachable from a root before that point. **A value read out of a root and
//! > held in an SSA register across a call is not rooted.** It is a copy, and
//! > the collector cannot see copies.
//!
//! A shadow slot has property (2) — the collector *rewrites* it on evacuation —
//! but a register loaded from it beforehand has only property (1), liveness.
//! The object survives, at a new address, and the register names the old one:
//!
//! ```llvm
//!   %r7 = alloca double
//!   store double %arg1, ptr %r7
//!   call void @js_shadow_slot_bind(i32 0, ptr %r7)   ; %r7 IS a root
//!   %r8 = load double, ptr %r7                       ; a COPY of the root
//!   %r9 = call double @build_schema()                 ; evacuates; rewrites %r7
//!   %r10 = call double @js_object_assign_one(double %r8, ...)  ; from-space
//! ```
//!
//! That is verbatim from `zod`'s object-spread lowering, and the very next
//! statement in the same function re-loads `%r7` — because a *fresh* lowering
//! of the same local emits a fresh load. The bug is never that codegen cannot
//! re-read the slot; it is that within one lowering the load happens once, at
//! the top, and the register is carried across everything that follows.
//!
//! # Why this is a pass and not another fix
//!
//! Because the shape is not in one lowering. Measured over the two IR corpora
//! (`scripts/gc_root_dominance_corpus.sh`, `scripts/gc_root_dominance_dep_corpus.sh`),
//! `--stale-registers --moving-only` reports 116 and 370 stale uses; 102 and 271
//! of them are this one shape, spread across the object-literal spread, the
//! inline class-field store, the numeric element store, `new`, property
//! define, `instanceof`, the closure-call family and more. `index_set.rs` alone
//! lowers `object` before `value` at fifteen separate arms. Fixing them one at
//! a time is what #7291 and #7299 did, correctly, without moving the acceptance
//! arm at all.
//!
//! So the fix is stated once, over the emitted CFG, where the property is
//! decidable:
//!
//! > For a load out of a shadow slot, every use that a collection point can
//! > reach re-reads the slot instead.
//!
//! # Why re-loading is sound, and when it is not
//!
//! Re-reading a slot is NOT unconditionally safe, and `rooting/temp_root.rs`'s
//! [`operand_is_reloadable`] documents exactly why: re-lowering a local reads
//! its value *now*, and "now" is after the later arguments have run — any of
//! which may have reassigned it. `new C(g, bump())` where `bump()` assigns `g`
//! must pass the pre-`bump()` `g`; re-lowering hands it the post-`bump()` one,
//! which is a miscompile rather than a rooting fix.
//!
//! That objection is about the SOURCE program's assignments, and at this level
//! they are visible: an assignment to a shadow-slotted local is a `store` to
//! its alloca in this function. (A local captured *and mutated* by a closure is
//! boxed instead — `boxed_vars.rs` — so it has no plain shadow slot to reload.)
//! So the rule carries its own side condition:
//!
//! > …unless a store to that slot can also run on the way, in which case the
//! > register is left alone.
//!
//! Both halves are path questions over the real CFG, not line order, and both
//! are answered here the same way `scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py` answers
//! them — a back-edge round trip is not an intra-iteration path, because
//! re-entering the load's block re-executes the load and produces a different
//! dynamic value.
//!
//! Left alone means left as it is today: the 17 curated and 39 dependency-scale
//! residuals where the slot is reassigned in the window are genuinely the
//! temp-root case, and they keep their existing behaviour rather than getting a
//! wrong one.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! A reload is one load from a stack slot. Where it was not needed — no call
//! between the two points — LLVM's EarlyCSE/GVN forwards it away, because with
//! no intervening call nothing can clobber the alloca. Where it *was* needed
//! the intervening call is opaque, LLVM must keep the load, and that is the
//! whole point. So the pass is close to free exactly where it is redundant.
//!
//! # Two things a slot load is not, and both are the same bug (#7664)
//!
//! `--statepoints` (#7663) pointed this rule at the NATIVE root lowering — the
//! one that actually ships — and reported 21 `unrooted` hazards. Seventeen were
//! shapes this pass looked straight through, because the rule above is stated
//! over *the load's own register* and both shapes hold the value elsewhere:
//!
//! 1. **The root is a global, not an alloca.** A string literal lowers to
//!    `load double, ptr @<mod>_.str.N.handle`. That global IS a registered root
//!    (`js_gc_register_global_root`, `codegen/string_pool.rs`), so the string is
//!    never swept — and an evacuating cycle REWRITES it while a register loaded
//!    beforehand keeps the pre-move address. Same property-(2) failure as a
//!    shadow slot, same one-load fix. `expr/temp_root.rs` already calls this
//!    `OperandProtection::Reload` and its soundness argument carries verbatim:
//!    the only writer of a handle global in generated code is
//!    `__perry_init_strings_*`, so re-reading cannot observe a later
//!    assignment. (The store side-condition below still runs, so the init
//!    function is excluded by the analysis rather than by that argument.)
//!
//! 2. **The register that goes stale is DERIVED from the load, not the load.**
//!    `this.count++` lowers to
//!
//!    ```llvm
//!      %r8  = load double, ptr %r7           ; the root slot
//!      %r9  = bitcast double %r8 to i64
//!      %r10 = and i64 %r9, 281474976710655   ; the unmasked receiver
//!      %r14 = call double @js_object_get_field_by_name_f64(i64 %r10, i64 %r13)
//!      call void @js_object_set_field_by_name(i64 %r10, i64 %r13, double %r16)
//!    ```
//!
//!    `%r8`'s only use is the `bitcast`, which is ABOVE the collecting call, so
//!    the rule as originally stated had nothing to rewrite and this function
//!    took zero reloads. The value that crosses the GET is `%r10`. Under the
//!    native lowering the same shape reads
//!    `%rN.rs4i = ptrtoint ptr addrspace(1) %s to i64`: LLVM relocates the
//!    `addrspace(1)` pointer and rewrites its uses, but it cannot touch an
//!    `i64` copy, so the unmask is where the value leaves the tracked domain
//!    for good. #7280's zod-`clone` shape and #7240's literal shape, meeting in
//!    one function.
//!
//! So the rule is restated over the value's *derivation* rather than its
//! register:
//!
//! > For a value read out of a collector-rewritten location — a shadow slot or
//! > a string-handle global — and any value derived from it by pure bit ops,
//! > every use that a collection point can reach re-materialises the whole
//! > derivation instead.
//!
//! A derivation ("recipe") is only extended through instructions that are pure
//! functions of their operands (`TRANSPARENT_BIN`, `TRANSPARENT_CAST`) and
//! whose every register operand is already in the same single root's recipe.
//! That makes a recipe self-contained — a load plus bit ops on constants — so
//! it materialises at any point in the function with no dominance question, and
//! re-executing it is by construction the same function of the same root
//! evaluated against the address the collector wrote back. Anything else (a
//! phi, a call, an operand from a second root) is not extended through and is
//! left exactly as it is today.
//!
//! Cost is unchanged in kind: where the window is empty nothing is inserted;
//! where it is not, the intervening call is opaque so LLVM must keep the
//! reload — and the re-derived `bitcast`/`and` above it are pure and fold.
