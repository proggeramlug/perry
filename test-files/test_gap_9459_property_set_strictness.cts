// #9459: `Expr::PropertySet` carries no strictness field, so every assignment
// form that lowers to it threw on a rejected `[[Set]]` in SLOPPY code, where
// node is silent.
//
// ES2024 SS6.2.5.7 (PutValue) performs `Set(O, P, V, Throw)` with
// `Throw = IsStrictReference(ref)`, and SS10.1.9 (OrdinarySet) reports `false`
// -- not a throw -- for a non-writable own or inherited data property, an
// accessor with no setter, and a new property on a non-extensible object. The
// reference's strictness is what turns that `false` into a TypeError.
//
// Three spellings of the same store disagreed on main:
//
//   o.x = 9      -> `Expr::PutValueSet`  (carries `strict`)         CORRECT
//   o.x++        -> `Expr::PropertyUpdate` (carries `strict`)       CORRECT
//   o.x += 1     -> `Expr::PropertySet`  (carries NOTHING)          THREW
//   for (o.x of) -> `Expr::PropertySet`                             THREW
//   [o.x] = arr  -> `Expr::PropertySet` (expression position)       THREW
//
// This is the object-path mirror of #9394 (arrays, fixed by #9426) and the
// opposite direction from #9422 (which was an UNDER-throw in strict code).
//
// This file is `.cts`, so it is a CommonJS script in BOTH runtimes: `sloppyArm`
// is sloppy code and `strictArm` opts in with its own directive prologue.
// BOTH ARMS ARE ASSERTED. Asserting only the sloppy no-op is what let #9422
// through, and asserting only the strict throw is what let this through.
//
// The two arms are textual duplicates on purpose: a function inherits the
// strictness of the code it is DEFINED in, never its caller's, so a shared
// helper would test one mode twice. Only the mode prefix and the directive
// differ.
//
// Companions: test_gap_9422_strict_object_store_strictness.cts (the `=` lane),
// test_gap_9394_array_element_store_strictness.cts (the array element lane),
// test_gap_9423_module_init_strictness.ts (the ESM always-strict half).
