// #9460: SIGSEGV on `o.<field> = v` when `o` is a scalar-replaced object
// literal and that field is never READ.
//
// `stmt/let_stmt.rs`'s scalar-replacement arm elides the heap allocation for a
// non-escaping `new` and gives each field its own stack alloca -- but for a
// synthetic `__AnonShape_*` class (what an object literal lowers to) it only
// creates slots for the fields in `non_escaping_new_used_fields`, which
// deliberately tracks READS:
//
//     "writes still need their RHS evaluated for JS side effects, but the
//      scalar slot/store can be elided when the field is never observed"
//                            -- collectors/escape_news.rs
//
// It then registers `ctx.locals[id]` = a DUMMY entry-block alloca that is never
// initialized, because the binding is no longer an object at all.
//
// `expr/property_get.rs` implements the read half of that contract: a property
// of a scalar-replaced local with no slot reads `undefined`, with a comment
// naming the hazard -- "the generic runtime helper that crashes on the dummy
// slot". `expr/property_set.rs` never implemented the write half. A store to a
// slotless field fell past the scalar arm into the class-field / `Ptr<Shape>`
// lowering, which loads the dummy slot as an `ObjectHeader*` and stores through
// `null + 16`.
//
// The crash needs the field to be written and NEVER read, which is why the
// original report's isolated attempt did not reproduce: it printed `o.x`
// afterwards, and that read is what creates the slot.
//
// It is NOT specific to sloppy mode, to `for (o.x of ...)`, or to a preceding
// throw -- `"use strict"; const o: any = {x:1}; o.x = 7;` segfaults too. This
// file is `.cts` so both modes live in one program.
//
// Each CRASH case prints a sentinel INSTEAD of reading the field: reading it is
// what hides the bug. The controls at the end deliberately do read, and say so.
