// #9489: `process.stdin` must chunk by READ-BUFFER boundaries, not by lines.
//
// Perry's fd-0 reader read stdin ONE BYTE PER `read(2)` and, in cooked
// flowing / pull mode, cut a `'data'` chunk at every `\n`. 1 MB of
// `"line\n"` therefore arrived as 200,000 `'data'` events in 2.10 s where
// Node delivers 16 in 0.04 s — a 52x slowdown driven by 1,048,576 read
// syscalls plus 200,000 JS callback dispatches. Input with no newline in it
// arrived as a single chunk, which is what pinned the cause on newlines
// rather than on size.
//
// The user-visible damage was in claude-code: under the event flood its
// stdin consumer gave up partway, so a piped prompt was truncated to a
// RANDOM prefix (612k / 455k / 394k / 374k chars of 1,000,000 across four
// runs). Feeding the same megabyte as one chunk, or as 1,000 x 1,000-char
// lines, produced the full prompt every time.
//
// Node's contract: a chunk is whatever one read of the underlying handle
// returned. Line splitting belongs to the consumer (readline does its own),
// never to the shared `'data'` path.
//
// The parity runner gives a fixture no stdin, so this test re-spawns itself
// with a pipe on the child's stdin and drives each shape in a child role.
//
// Event counts cannot be compared byte-for-byte across engines — Node's pipe
// reads are 64 KiB, Perry's are 64 KiB but land on a different tick boundary
// — so the flood arms assert an ORDER OF MAGNITUDE (`< 100`, against Node's
// 16 and the unfixed engine's 200,000) plus exact byte counts and exact
// content. The `trickle` arm is the opposite guard: three writes spaced in
// time must stay THREE events, so a "fix" that simply glues the whole stream
// into one chunk fails here.
