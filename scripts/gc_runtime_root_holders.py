"""Runtime-side GC-pointer holder custody gate (#7231; ffi/ext/ui coverage 2026-08).

A `thread_local!` or `static` that stores a pointer into the GC heap **is a GC
root**, and the collector only knows that if something registers it via
`gc_register_*root_scanner*`. An unregistered holder is not an intermittent
bug: it goes bad at collection #0 and stays bad, so the symptom is a
*perfectly reproducible* use-after-free — the opposite tell from the #7154
stale-register class.

Nothing static could find this class before. `scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py`
reads emitted LLVM IR, and a runtime table is not in it — that is not a gap in
that tool, it is outside its subject. #7226, #7239, #7268 and #7274 were all
found by hand. This script is the enumeration those fixes kept re-deriving,
turned into something that can fail.

That asymmetry is also why the CRATE SET below must be complete. The static
checker is structurally blind to every Rust-side table, in every crate, so
this census is the ONLY detector for the whole class — and a crate outside
its scope is not "less checked", it is UNCHECKED. The `perry-ext-*` crates
park user closures in handle side tables (a `WsClientListeners.listeners`
value, a `BackoffState.task`); those closures cross the C ABI as NaN-boxed
`i64`/`f64`, so nothing in their declared types says "heap pointer" — which
is exactly how this census reported clean over them for months: its two
original rules could not parse the shape, and its crate list did not include
the crates. A gate whose subject never ran. If you widen the crate set again,
extend the RULES to the new crates' value-representation first, or you are
adding green paint, not coverage.

What it does
------------

1. **Enumerate** every `static` / `thread_local!` / `lazy_static!` declaration
   whose stored type can hold a GC heap pointer. Three crate tiers:

   * **core** (`perry-runtime`, `perry-stdlib`): rule A (the type names a heap
     header type or `JSValue`) and rule B (an integer/`f64` cell that some
     function in its own file both names and allocates in, which is how
     `CACHED_ENV: Cell<f64>` — the highest-impact holder in #7231's original
     report — has to be caught).
   * **ffi-side, gated** (`perry-ffi`, every `crates/perry-ext-*` — discovered
     by GLOB, so a new ext crate is in scope the day it is created): JS values
     cross the C ABI as NaN-boxed `i64`/`f64`, so the rules read the TYPE
     SHAPE instead of type names — rule V (an `i64`/`u64`/`f64` in a container
     VALUE position: `Vec<i64>` listener lists, `HashMap<K, f64>` callback
     maps; map KEYS are exempt, they are handle ids), rule S (a container of a
     crate-local struct/enum whose fields can hold such a value —
     `HashMap<u64, BackoffState>` where `BackoffState.task` is NaN-box bits;
     resolved recursively through crate-local types), rule E (a type-erased
     `dyn` payload in value position — `DashMap<Handle, Box<dyn Any>>` can
     hold anything, including a struct full of closures), and rule F (a BARE
     integer/`f64` scalar in a file where some function both names it and
     touches closure/NaN-box machinery). Declarations inside function bodies
     (`static T: OnceLock<..> = ..` in an accessor fn) and `lazy_static!`'s
     `static ref` are parsed; multi-line declarations are joined.
   * **frontier** (`crates/perry-ui*` — also by glob): same rules, but tracked
     by an identity-pinned ratchet instead of per-holder verdicts. See
     "The frontier tier" below.

   TLS macros are also a deliberate fourth rule: every raw `thread_local!`
   (including `std::thread_local!`) or `perry_thread_local!` (including
   `crate::perry_thread_local!`) declaration in the core
   crates that rules A/B do not already recognize is enumerated as rule T. The
   macro accepts arbitrary crate-local types, so treating an unfamiliar type as
   safe would recreate the blind spot this census exists to close. Rule-T
   holders use the same identity-pinned ratchet as the UI frontier until each
   stored type has a researched verdict.

2. **Compute coverage** rather than trusting names. The registered scanner set
   is read from every `gc_register_*root_scanner*(...)` call site; a call graph
   over all `fn` bodies in every scanned crate is walked from those roots to
   `MAX_SCANNER_DEPTH`, and a holder counts as covered when its identifier
   appears in a reachable function **defined in the same file as the
   declaration**. The same-file requirement is not incidental: `REGISTRY`,
   `SLOTS`, `ROOTS`, `STATES`, `CACHED` and `CLOSE_CALLBACK` each name several
   different holders in this tree, and a name-only match certifies the wrong
   one. The call-graph walk is what finds the holders a scanner reaches through
   an accessor (`cp_live_lock()`, `get_closure_props()`, `buffer_props()`)
   rather than by name.

3. **Require a verdict** for everything left over. Each uncovered gated holder
   must appear in `scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.json` with a `verdict` and a
   `why`. A holder with no entry fails; an entry that matches no holder fails
   (a stale exemption is how these gates rot — same rule as
   `scripts/gc_root_dominance_allowlist.json`).

The identity-pinned frontier
----------------------------

The `perry-ui*` crates hold hundreds of NaN-boxed callback tables
(`BUTTON_CALLBACKS: RefCell<HashMap<usize, f64>>` × every widget × eight
platform crates), none of them registered with the GC. Several of those crates
cannot even be BUILT on the host that runs this gate (windows/android/gtk4),
so "fix them all in the commit that widens the census" would mean shipping
unverifiable edits — the exact sin this repo's gate history warns about. The
honest alternative is neither exempting them (a `not_a_gc_pointer` verdict for
a real callback table would be a lie) nor ignoring them (the blind spot this
extension closes):

* every frontier holder is ENUMERATED by the same rules,
* the population is pinned BY IDENTITY (`file` + `name`) in the inventory's
  `frontier` list,
* a NEW frontier holder fails this gate immediately — growth is loud, the
  original blind spot cannot re-open,
* a frontier entry matching nothing also fails — the list can only shrink,
  and fixing a holder (registering a scanner that reaches it) forces its
  entry to be deleted.

A frontier entry is a precisely-named piece of debt, not a verdict. When a UI
crate gains real scanner coverage, its holders read as covered, their entries
go stale, and the deletion is the receipt.

The same ratchet also carries otherwise-unclassified core declarations inside
raw or Perry TLS macros. Unlike a plain `static` declaration, each of these is a
known state-holding TLS slot even when its type is a crate-local struct that
rules A/B cannot resolve (`PathModuleRegistry`, `ExceptionState`, and
`YogaNode` are real examples). A newly declared slot therefore fails until it
is covered or deliberately pinned. More importantly, a currently covered slot
is absent from the baseline, so deleting the scanner that reaches it makes it a
NEW frontier holder and turns the gate red.

How it fails
------------

* a new uncovered gated holder with no inventory entry -> exit 1
* an inventory entry that no longer matches a declaration -> exit 1
* an `open_gap` or `unverified` verdict -> exit 1; old-page relocation ships
  enabled, so a known or unevaluated movable-address holder cannot be exempted
* a `non_moving_snapshot` whose source pins or closed reference set changed -> exit 1
* a frontier/rule-T holder not in the pinned `frontier` list -> exit 1 (ratchet up)
* a `frontier` entry matching no holder -> exit 1 (ratchet down / stale)
* fewer than MIN_HOLDERS declarations matched -> exit 2, because a regex that
  stopped matching would otherwise report a clean, empty, green run
* fewer than MIN_REGISTERED registered scanners found -> exit 2, same reason:
  if the registration regex breaks, EVERYTHING reads as uncovered and the run
  is noise rather than a gate

`--self-test` plants each shape into a temp tree and requires the scanner to
reject it, and requires it NOT to flag a holder that a registered scanner
genuinely reaches — including through one hop of accessor indirection. Run it
before trusting a green scan.

What this gate CANNOT see
-------------------------

Named, because an unstated limit is how a gate gets trusted past its subject.

* **`RuntimeState`-owned tables.** `crates/perry-runtime/src/state.rs` absorbed
  roughly a dozen former `thread_local!`s (`descriptors`, `object_hot` and its
  `overflow_fields` / `shape_cache_overflow` / `transition_cache`,
  `field_lookup`, `shapes`, and `exotic_expando`). They are struct FIELDS,
  reached through `state()`, so no declaration-site scan sees them. All are
  covered today: in particular, `exotic_expando` is visited by
  `scan_exotic_expando_roots_mut`. A new field added there is invisible here.
  `STATE_FIELD_FLOOR` below asserts the struct has not grown past the field
  count this was checked at, so growth is at least *loud*.
* **A non-TLS integer-typed holder whose own file never calls an allocator, in a CORE
  crate.** Rule B needs a function that both names the holder and allocates; a
  cell written purely from a value handed in across a module boundary has
  neither, and is invisible. The ffi-side shape rules (V/S/E/F) close exactly
  this hole for the ffi/ext/ui crates — where it is the NORM, every value
  arrives across the ABI — but they are deliberately NOT applied to
  `perry-runtime`/`perry-stdlib`: measured 2026-08, they would add ~150 new
  core candidates, each needing a researched verdict, which is a separate
  tightening campaign. Until someone runs it, a core `Mutex<Vec<i64>>` table
  in a non-allocating file is still invisible here.
* **A holder reached by a scanner in a DIFFERENT file.** It reads as uncovered
  and needs an inventory entry saying so; `verdict: "covered_elsewhere"` is that
  entry, and it records which scanner.
* **Module identity beyond the FIRST hop.** The registration text carries the
  path (`crate::json::raw_json::scan_raw_json_key_root_mut`), so the registered
  root set is resolved to a file — two modules defining `scan_tls_roots_mut`
  (which perry-runtime and perry-stdlib really do) cannot certify each other's
  holders. Deeper hops are matched on the bare name, because nothing in the text
  says which module a call resolved to; that direction over-approximates
  coverage, and an inventory entry is the correction.
* **Whether a "covered" holder is covered CORRECTLY.** The scanner may visit
  three of a table's four slots — the shape #7239 found in
  `scan_parent_port_event_roots_mut`. Reading the body is the only way, and this
  gate does not read semantics. It bounds the population; it does not audit it.
